The format for the lexical sample files is similar to previous years,
except for an addition of the wordnet (wn) and wordnet version
(wn-version) attributes to the answer tag which represent the wordnet
sense grouping for the OntoNotes sense id (senseid) attribute.

The sense-inventories directory contains the sense grouping
information for the lemmas.

for scoring purposes, we will be using the senseval 3 scorer2
software. you can use the same scorer to tune your systems, and the
format of the answers should adhere to its requirement,

information on the scorer software is available at:
