Last month , Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner forced Northwest Airlines to reduce a stake held by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines . But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision . And he has kept mum on how his decision might <head> affect </head> a bid for United Airlines , which includes a big stake by British Airways PLC . Some analysts say uncertainty about Washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop . In many ways , the backdrop to Friday 's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987 's 508-point crash .

Mr. Mitchell 's relations with Budget Director Darman , who pushed for a capital-gains cut to be added to the measure , have been strained since Mr. Darman chose to bypass the Maine Democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal 1989 supplemental spending bill . The deficit reduction bill contains $ 5.3 billion in tax increases in fiscal 1990 , and $ 26 billion over five years . The revenue-raising provisions , which <head> affect </head> mostly corporations , would : -- Prevent companies that have made leveraged buy-outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance the buy-outs , effective Aug. 2 , 1989 . -- Require mutual funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on the date that the dividends are declared rather than received , effective the day after the tax bill is enacted .

In Manhattan , once-desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill . Retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy , turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom .

But on average , Manhattan retail rents have dropped 10 % to 15 % in the past six months alone , experts say . That follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months , after Manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986 .

But the airlines are scarcely a clear case , given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner , who professes to believe safety will be compromised if KLM and British Airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes .

James Oberstar , the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee 's aviation subcommittee , has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to <head> affect </head> the American and United Air Lines bids . It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion or more .

I submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be .

In the recent political campaign two charges were leveled <head> affecting </head> the question of power , and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus . One was demonstrably false ; ; the other , for the most part , true . The first was that America had become -- or was in danger of becoming -- a second-rate military power .

If anti-Semitism was on trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department of Jewish Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as well as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ? ? The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich in January 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe , was attended by representatives of major organs of the German state , including the Reich Minister of the Interior , the State Secretary in charge of the Four Year Plan , the Reich Minister of Justice , the Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs . The measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the Conference <head> affected </head> industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government . Heydrich , in opening the Conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as `` a complement to '' previous `` solutions '' for eliminating the Jews from German living space through violence , economic strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation . In other words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder .

Tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb - or finger-sucking , tongue-thrusting , or lip-sucking -- but it 's important to remember that there 's a difference between normal and excessive sucking habits . It 's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs , and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old . Occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not <head> affect </head> a youngster 's teeth ; ; but after that , if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent , it will have an effect . Malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long . If a child loses a molar at the age of two , the adjoining teeth may shift toward the empty space , thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent ones and producing a jumble .

This must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue grows , and no faster . `` If teeth are moved too rapidly , serious injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding bone holding them in place '' , explains Dr. Brodie . `` Moving one or two teeth can <head> affect </head> the whole system , and an ill-conceived plan of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child 's face '' . During the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately following each adjustment , Susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness , but after a short time this will disappear .

growth studies have been carried on consistently by orthodontists .

Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter . He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution . <head> Allowing </head> the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . Absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify . Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .

Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in one respect : Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict . That 's why it 's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police , on college campuses and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences . As Elizabeth Kristol wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason donnybrook , `` Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were <head> allowed </head> to simmer . '' The question is , if group conflicts still exist ( as undeniably they do ) , and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ? Do n't say the TV sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy .

Under that standard , which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices , a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a `` reasonable '' justification for adopting it .

The one way to get around them -- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking to it -- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money . Only then , perhaps , will he reveal his jewels and his bargains . Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be <head> allowed </head> to rest for several weeks before it is served . This is especially true of red wines , and a practice which , though not always practicable , is well worth the effort . It does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter of days , but in terms of months and years it is fatal .

This invariably effaces any wine 's character , and drives its fragrance underground . It should not be forgotten that wines mature fastest in half-bottles , less fast in full bottles , slowly in Magnums -- and slower yet in Tregnums , double Magnums , Jeroboams , Methuselahs , and Imperiales , respectively . Very old red wines often require several hours of aeration , and any red wine , brought from the cellar within half an hour of mealtime , should be uncorked and <head> allowed </head> some air . But white wines never ! ! White wines should be opened when served , having been previously chilled in proportion to their sweetness .

Thus , Sauternes or Barsacs should be very cold ; ; a Pouilly-Fuisse or a Chablis somewhat less cold . Over-chilling is an accepted method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white wine , especially a dry wine -- and certainly less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive . The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is <head> allowed </head> to warm or is exposed for long to the air . To quote Professor Saintsbury : `` The last glass of claret or Burgundy is as good as the first ; ; but the first glass of Chateau d'Yquem or Montrachet is a great deal better than the last '' ! ! This does not mean , though , that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration : there is a reasonable limit -- and wines kept over to the next meal or the next day , after they have once been opened , are never as good .

The cork should be pulled gradually and smoothly , and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward . Many people use wicker cradles for old red wine , lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table , without disturbing the sediment . Another school frowns on such a shortcut , and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to <head> allow </head> the sediment to roll to the very bottom , after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position on its side in the cradle . In France , when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines , one visits the restaurant well ahead of time , chooses the wines and , with the advice of the manager and his chef , builds the menu around them . The wine waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened at least in time to warm and aerate , preferably allowed to stand on end for as long as possible and , perhaps in the case of very old wines , be decanted .

For , in the process of decanting , the bottle is only tilted once instead of several or more times at the table : hence , a minimum of the undesirable mixture of wine and dregs .

Bailly , after leaving Fort Snelling in August 1821 , was forced to leave some of the cattle at the Hudson 's Bay Company 's post on Lake Traverse `` in the Sieux Country '' and reached Fort Garry , as the Selkirk Hudson 's Bay Company center was now called , late in the fall .

The Roman Catholic Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method , also known as the use of the infertile or safe period . The Church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author : It involves no frustration of nature 's laws , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them . With the exception of the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic Churches , most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives , <head> allowing </head> the couple free choice . There is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement . The grounds for the Church 's position are Scriptural ( Old Testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural law .

Article II places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. . It also empowers the president to make recess appointments , without Senate approval : `` The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate , by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session . '' Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides : `` No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to <head> approve </head> the nomination of said person .

In general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical .

The board <head> approved </head> and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family planning .

The general board declared : `` Most of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right .

This viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country .

Whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt to avoid or be shocked by nudity , those educated beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and <head> approved </head> nudity in sexual relations . Such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that her husband had `` never seen her entirely naked '' , while another woman , boasting an equal number of years of married life , is proud of having `` shared the nudist way of life -- the really free , natural nude life -- for most of that period '' . Attempts at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions .

By some measures , metropolitan Denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years . Its population has continued to increase since 1983 , the peak year of the economic cycle .

In a self-fulfilling prophecy , therefore , the region 's real-estate market all but collapsed in recent years . Housing building permits are down more than 75 % from their 1983 peaks . Although no one can predict when metropolitan Denver 's real-estate market will rebound , major public works projects costing several billion dollars are under way or planned -- such as a new convention center , a major beltway encircling the metropolitan <head> area </head> , and a new regional airport .

And so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the hundred-odd folklore courses given in the United States survive on sentiment and nationalism alone .

And while every writer must be dealt with as a special case , the interested student will want to <head> ask </head> himself a number of questions about each . Does the writer know the difference between an `` ersatz '' ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk ? ?

Despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs . In June 1845 , the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20 per cent duty on imports via Hudson 's Bay which were viewed as aimed at the `` very vitals of the Company 's trade and power '' . To reduce further the flow of goods from England , the Company 's local officials <head> asked </head> that its London authorities refrain from forwarding any more trade goods to these men . With their customary source of supply cut off , the Fort Garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country . Others carried pemmican from `` the Forks '' to St. Paul and goods from St. Paul to Red River , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , Wells , transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement .

This , in fact , it turned out to be . Since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling German industries , social institutions , and armed forces became , through their anti-Semitism or their tolerance of it , conscious accomplices of Hitler 's crimes ; ; whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually . What more could be <head> asked </head> for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable Anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute ? ? Not in Eichmann 's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial . No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of Jews , as do others like them today .

Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ? ? The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization : fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; ; clinging to the enemy-Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; ; once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . `` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? ? The Trial should have <head> asked </head> the nations . But though this characterization in no way diminished Eichmann 's guilt , the Prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of it . Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters -- i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia -- and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity -- Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ? ?

Perhaps they are mourning a recent death and want comfort , to feel in touch with the deceased , or seek indications for future plans . They may , of course , be curiosity seekers -- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship .

The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium 's ESP may tap the memory of the sitter , and to do this , the two central characters in this drama must be separated . One way to do this is by `` proxy sittings '' , wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute , the proxy sitter . If the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name ( given by the experimenter ) , he can not possibly give any clues , conscious or unconscious , far less <head> ask </head> leading questions . All he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner , seeking to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal impressions . Sometimes in these experiments `` appointment sittings '' are used .

Sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery and seems to see all details in perspective , as if the scene were actually there . If pressed by the sitter for more detail , she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply , almost as if she were physically going closer . If <head> asked </head> how she gets her impressions , she probably can only say that she `` just gets them '' -- some more vividly than others . Perhaps this is not so extraordinary after all . Even in normal experience one gets impressions without knowing exactly how -- of atmosphere , of one another 's personalities , moods , intentions .

The 1990 appropriations legislation <head> attempts </head> to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II . Article II places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. .

Freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation Of Dreams , Chapter 1 : : As `` a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case , , and what is more , every one <head> attempting </head> such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' . Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities .

The company said local <head> authorities </head> held hearings on the allegations last spring and had returned the plant to `` routine inspection '' in August . `` The company does not feel that it or any of the individuals violated any criminal statute and the company expects full vindication in court . '' Arraignments are scheduled for Nov. 14 .

In most of the British transactions , the municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks , which would make fixed-rate payments .

The council backed the audit commission 's stand that the swap transactions are illegal . Although the Hammersmith and Fulham council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such capital-markets transactions , the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils .

`` It 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it , '' said one Senate aide . The bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out . Currently , the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established <head> authority </head> to block mergers , but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit . Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline-acquisition process , and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry . In general , the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30-day review period before 15 % or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired .

It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition . The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided , or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest . If more information is needed , the secretary would have <head> authority </head> to extend the review period 20 days . All the witnesses , both congressmen and industry experts , expressed support for the bill in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe , cost-effective service . But several committee members disapproved , some backing Mr. Trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock-market plunge .

Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing .

The president could probably not <head> avoid </head> this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government .

The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion .

Interpretation , naturally , remains the role of the therapist , but orientation -- not only the patient 's vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic background , but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways of danger spots in his relationship to people -- can be considerably beefed up by the linguist . His esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties , making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient . In one now-historic first interview , for example , the transcript ( reproduced from the book , The First Five Minutes ) goes like this : The therapist 's level tone is bland and neutral -- he has , for example , <head> avoided </head> stressing `` you '' , which would imply disapproval ; ; or surprise , which would set the patient apart from other people . The patient , on the other hand , is far from neutral ; ; aside from her specifically regional accent , she reveals by the use of the triad , `` irritable , tense , depressed '' , a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language ( i.e. , she must have had at least a high-school education ) , and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before . Then she catapults into `` everything and everybody '' , putting particular violence on `` everybody '' , indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag -- that is , it is not congruent to the patient 's general style of speech up to this point .

A white wine , already at cool cellar temperature , may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator ( the former is far preferable ) in about fifteen minutes ; ; for those who live in a winter climate , there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow .

Sharp increases in the price of fresh produce caused Spain 's September consumer price index to shoot up 1.1 % from the previous month , pushing the annual rate of inflation to 6.8 % , the National Institute of Statistics said Friday . The monthly increase is the highest recorded in the past four years . The index , which registered 156.8 at the end of September , has a <head> base </head> of 100 set in 1983 and is n't seasonally adjusted . Prices have risen 5.9 % in the first nine months of the year , outstripping both the initial 3 % inflation goal set by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and the second , revised goal of 5.8 % .

Nasdaq 's Small Order Execution System `` worked beautifully , '' as did the automated system for larger trades , according to Mr. Hardiman .

Because Nasdaq 's trading volume has n't returned to pre-crash levels , traders and OTC market officials hope the damage wo n't be permanent . But they are worried .

In an announcement to its staff last week , executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine said Time will `` dramatically de-emphasize '' its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives ; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000 , to four million ; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ 4 to $ 55 . In a related development , the news-weekly , for the fourth year in a row , said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in 1990 ; a full , four-color page in the magazine costs about $ 120,000 . However , because the guaranteed circulation <head> base </head> is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , according to Richard Heinemann , Time associate publisher . Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high , and expensive , circulations is the way to draw advertisers . In recent years , Reader 's Digest , New York Times Co. 's McCall 's , and most recently News Corp. 's TV Guide , have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers .

Still , the lesson is about the same : On Friday the 13th , the market was spooked by Washington . The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover , and it 's certainly true the rout <head> began </head> immediately after the UAL trading halt . Still , the consensus seems almost as wide that one faltering bid is no reason to write down the value of all U.S. business . This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn : the success of Senate Democrats in stalling the capital gains tax cut .

In addition , there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of 1981 , according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . `` The era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it , '' says James Grant , editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer , an early critic of the junk bond market . `` What we 've <head> begun </head> to see is the damage to businesses of paying exorbitant compound interest . Businesses were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings . What we 're seeing now is the wrenching readjustment of asset values to a future when speculative-grade debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy . ''

Striking auto workers ended their 19-day occupation of a metal shop at a Peugeot S.A. factory in eastern France Friday as pay talks got under way in the capital .

The Peugeot metalworkers <head> began </head> filing out of the shop , which makes auto parts , at the plant in Mulhouse after voting 589 to 193 to abandon the occupation . Their withdrawal was based on promises by Peugeot to open negotiations in Paris at the same time the last man left the premises . The strike by customs officers , tax collectors , treasury workers and other civil servants attached to the Ministry of Finance may pose a more serious challenge to the government and the average Frenchman .

The eight major domestic auto makers sold 160,510 North American-made cars in the first 10 days of October , a 12.6 % drop from a year earlier . Domestically built truck sales were down 10.4 % to 86,555 pickups , vans and sport utility vehicles . The heavy use of incentives to clear out 1989 models appears to have taken the steam , at least initially , out of 1990 model sales , which <head> began </head> officially Oct. 1 . This appears particularly true at GM , which had strong sales in August and September but saw its early October car and truck results fall 26.3 % from last year 's unusually high level .

Some extremists went so far as to urge our using it first . To silence extremists , to warn the Axis , President Roosevelt issued this statement for the Allies in August : `` From time to time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the Axis powers were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare . I have been loath to <head> believe </head> that any nation , even our present enemies , could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons . `` However , evidence that the Axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources . `` Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind .

The people who <head> believe </head> and retell the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points , always to the detriment of Lizzie .

Only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be .

The evidence suggests that foreign peoples <head> believe </head> the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead . This ignorant estimate , I repeat , is not of any interest in itself ; ; but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do -- namely , by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side . To the extent , then , that declining U.S. prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern .

Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports ? ? Was n't this meaning of Eichmann 's experience in various countries worth highlighting ? ?

Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities .

Rep.

The Michigan Democrat 's proposal , which is expected today , is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the Bush administration 's plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain . The administration 's plan could cost utilities , mainly those that use coal , up to $ 4 billion a year .

That proposal had been hailed by environmentalists but despised by utilities because they feared it would limit their growth . It also would junk an innovative market-based system for trading emissions credits among polluters . In addition , it is believed to offer a cost-sharing mechanism that would help subsidize the clean-up costs for the dirtiest coal-fired utilities in the country , sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric <head> bills </head> . The administration , sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases , has staunchly opposed cost-sharing . Mr. Dingell 's staff was expected to present its acid-rain alternative to other committee members , apparently in an attempt to appease Midwestern lawmakers from high-polluting states who insist on cost-sharing .

It is n't clear , however , whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the White House 's acid-rain plan . While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities , it might not win the support of utilities , many in the West , that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels . Lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the White House to devise ways to tinker with the administration <head> bill </head> to address their acid-rain concerns .

For the year to date , Moody 's said total returns were topped by the 16.5 % of longer-term Treasury issues , closely followed by 15 % for investment-grade bonds . Junk bonds trailed the group again . `` Even the 7.2 % return from the risk-free three-month Treasury <head> bill </head> has easily outdistanced the 4.1 % return from junk bonds , '' wrote Moody 's economist John Lonski in yesterday 's market report . `` Little wonder that buyers for junk have been found wanting , '' he said .

Congress learned during the Reagan administration that it could intimidate the executive branch by uttering again and again the same seven words : `` Provided , that no funds shall be spent ... . '' This phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations <head> bills </head> now moving through Congress . It signals Congress 's attempt , under the pretext of guarding the public purse , to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in Article II of the Constitution . This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional .

The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary . The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government . The 1990 appropriations <head> bills </head> also contain a number of `` muzzling '' provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution . Muzzling provisions , which might be called `` blindfold laws '' as well , prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options , let alone from recommending them to Congress . Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations .

Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations . Typically , these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations . Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations <head> bill </head> for the executive office that prevents the president 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny . There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other . Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States .

President Reagan learned that lesson . By 1987 , then-Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II . If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded , the president could sign the appropriations <head> bills </head> into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable . The Constitution does not expressly give the president such power . However , the president does have a duty not to violate the Constitution .

Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto . As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives . The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations <head> bill </head> would be a power of far more limited applicability . One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers . There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills .

Hammerschmidt said that the provision , which he dubbed a `` special interest '' amendment , was likely to make the <head> bill </head> even more controversial . On Tuesday , the House approved a labor-backed amendment that would require the Transportation Department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code . The provision , called the `` two-time-losers '' amendment by its supporters , apparently was aimed at preventing Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline .

The conference approved at least $ 55 million in direct cash and development assistance as well , and though no decision was made , both sides are committed to adding more than $ 200 million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the Bush administration . The agreement on Poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill , which has already provoked veto threats by the White House and is sharply confined under this year 's budget . These fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the Poland package , and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending , the appropriations <head> bill </head> in conference will be more decisive on U.S. aid to Eastern Europe . To accommodate the additional cash assistance , the House Appropriations Committee last week was required to reallocate an estimated $ 140 million from the Pentagon . And though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant , recent experience with a similar program in Central America indicates that it could take several years before the new Polish government can fully use the aid effectively .

About a quarter of this share has already been reallocated , according to the industry , but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current U.S. price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate .

But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower states , such as North Carolina .

Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying <head> bill </head> was the subject of behind-the-scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane , but politically important , projects of members . In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida , Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor . `` Anybody can vote as they want , '' said Rep.

`` Anybody can vote as they want , '' said Rep. William Lehman ( D. , Fla. ) , head of the House conferees . `` But if you make a request , you should support the committee . '' Within the Federal Aviation Administration , the final <head> bill </head> promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20 % from last year , and total operations would rise to $ 3.84 billion -- a 12 % boost . The facilities account includes $ 40 million for Denver 's ambitious new airport , and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in Philadelphia and Michigan and the major carriers to Denver , United and Continental . Leery of the costs -- and , critics say , competition -- the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of Denver .

Friday 's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the House and Senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest . Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit . `` The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their <head> bill </head> '' of similar provisions , Sen. Warren Rudman ( R. , N.H . ) . said yesterday . The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion . Rep. Panetta said that OMB 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . ''

'' Another big question hovering over the debate is what President Bush thinks . He has been resisting a stripped-down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut .

One high-profile provision that was originally in the Senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen ( D. , Texas ) of the Senate Finance Committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts . Mr. Bentsen said he hopes the Senate will consider that measure soon . To the delight of some doctors , the <head> bill </head> dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under Medicare . To the detriment of many low-income people , efforts to boost Medicaid funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken . Asked why senators were giving up so much , New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici , the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee , said , `` We 're looking like idiots .

It worked , others said , because there were no exceptions : all revenue-losing provisions were stricken . The Senate also dropped a plan by its Finance Committee that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their Social Security benefits reduced . In addition , the <head> bill </head> dropped a plan to make permanent a 3 % excise tax on long-distance telephone calls . It no longer includes a plan that would have repealed what remains of the completed-contract method of accounting , which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden . It also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current retirees .

Though the argument may have a common-sense ring to it , even the S&amp;L lawyers concede there 's little precedent to back their position . Still , one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to entertain the notion , and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law . The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC 's massive legal <head> bills </head> , which topped $ 73 million last year . The S&amp;L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate-court ruling in two cases brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings &amp; Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch , best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team . Sunbelt foreclosed on the ranch .

It would be a good thing if Congress started to decide issues one-by-one on their individual merits without trickery .

Especially so since President Bush has been weakened by the Panama fiasco . To the extent that the UAL troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of Washington 's sticky fingers .

But the airlines are scarcely a clear case , given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner , who professes to believe safety will be compromised if KLM and British Airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes . Worse , Congress has started to jump on the Skinner bandwagon . James Oberstar , the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee 's aviation subcommittee , has put an anti-airline takeover <head> bill </head> on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the American and United Air Lines bids . It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion or more . So the UAL deal has problems , and the market loses 190 points .

It involves accepting risk , or giving up income , or deferring a career . It follows that proposals like Nunn-McCurdy , whose benefits to enrollees are worth some $ 17,500 a year , do not qualify . There is a rationale for such <head> bills </head> : Federal subsidies to college students amount to `` a GI Bill without the GI '' ; arguably those benefits should be earned , not given .

Jerry Shrieves , UAW local president , said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a `` flex plant , '' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand . At the Oklahoma City plant , which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars , Steve Featherston , UAW local vice president , said the plant has no new product lined up , and `` none of us knows '' when the A-body cars will die . He said he believes GM has plans to keep <head> building </head> A-body cars into the mid-1990s . At Pontiac , however , the Camaro-Firebird decision appears to erase UAW hopes that GM would reopen the shuttered assembly plant that last built the plastic-bodied , two-seater Pontiac Fiero model . The Fiero plant was viewed as a model of union-management cooperation at GM before slow sales of the Fiero forced the company to close the factory last year .

They plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools , computers and other high-technology products . But the Bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all Cocom members are complying fully with existing export-control procedures before it will support further liberalization . To make its point , it is challenging the Italian government to explain reports that Olivetti may have supplied the Soviet Union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to <head> build </head> parts for combat aircraft . The London Sunday Times , which first reported the U.S. concerns , cited a U.S. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that Olivetti exported $ 25 million in `` embargoed , state-of-the-art , flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry . '' Olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in 1984 .

Dismal sales at General Motors Corp. dragged the U.S. car and truck market down below year-ago levels in early October , the first sales period of the 1990 model year . The eight major domestic auto makers sold 160,510 North American-made cars in the first 10 days of October , a 12.6 % drop from a year earlier . Domestically <head> built </head> truck sales were down 10.4 % to 86,555 pickups , vans and sport utility vehicles . The heavy use of incentives to clear out 1989 models appears to have taken the steam , at least initially , out of 1990 model sales , which began officially Oct. 1 . This appears particularly true at GM , which had strong sales in August and September but saw its early October car and truck results fall 26.3 % from last year 's unusually high level .

It was a hardy undertaking , and Wheelock 's was indeed `` a voice crying in the wilderness '' . A road had to be hacked through trackless forests between Hanover and Portsmouth to permit Governor Wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first Dartmouth commencement in 1771 .

Many people use wicker cradles for old red wine , lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table , without disturbing the sediment . Another school frowns on such a shortcut , and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom , after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position on its side in the cradle . In France , when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines , one visits the restaurant well ahead of time , chooses the wines and , with the advice of the manager and his chef , <head> builds </head> the menu around them . The wine waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened at least in time to warm and aerate , preferably allowed to stand on end for as long as possible and , perhaps in the case of very old wines , be decanted . Decanting old wine aerates it fully ; ; it may also be -- practically speaking -- a matter of good economy .

It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward .

When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm out of the United States , its British-born employees , now become American citizens -- Joseph Rolette , Joseph Renville and Alexis Bailly -- continued in the fur business . On Big Stone Lake near the headwaters of the Red River , Robert Dickson , Superintendent of the Western Indian Department of Canada , had a trading post and planned in 1818 to <head> build </head> a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces . His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks of Red River and from Selkirk 's settlement he brought them south in carts . These carts were of a type devised in Pembina in the days of Alexander Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk colony was begun .

In 1837 , 157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at Fort Snelling .

The resultant town , platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father Galtier 's mission , St. Paul , was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those Selkirkers who remained at Red River .

The Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-Semitism '' among the Germans which Hitler `` stimulated and transformed '' .

`` To be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist -- to produce where nothing was before -- to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power '' .

Unlike mutual funds , which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money , big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock .

Timbers , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc . The $ 56 billion California Public Employees Retirement System , for one , added $ 1 billion to its stock portfolio two years ago . `` The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders , and that they ca n't react to short-term events , good or bad , '' said Stephen L.

Congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess , urging the studios and the networks , which license rights to air shows made by the studios , to work out their own compromise . But recent developments have made the networks -- and NBC President Robert Wright , in particular -- ever more adamant that the networks must be unshackled to survive . The latest provocation : Sony Corp. 's plan to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $ 3.4 billion , and to <head> buy </head> independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million . `` I wonder what Walter Cronkite will think of the Sony\/Columbia Broadcast System Trinitron Evening News with Dan Rather broadcast exclusively from Tokyo , '' wrote J.B.

An NBC spokesman counters that Mr. Holston 's lament was `` entirely consistent '' with NBC plans because the U.S. rules would limit NBC 's involvement in the Qintex deal so severely as to be `` light years away from the type of unrestrained deals available to Sony -- and everyone else except the three networks . '' The Big Three 's drumbeat for deregulation began intensifying in the summer when the former Time Inc. went ahead with plans to acquire Warner . Although Time already had a long-term contract to <head> buy </head> movies from Warner , the merger will let Time 's largely unregulated pay-cable channel , Home Box Office , own the Warner movies aired on HBO -- a vertical integration that is effectively blocked by fin-syn regulations .

`` A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible . '' Standard &amp; Poor 's Corp. says First Boston , Shearson and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , in particular , are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead .

That 's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors . Whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly , Wall Street 's new penchant for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years .

Lots of other entries made up the parade , of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices , signalling Federal Reserve tightness ; and the Bush administration 's ( temporary ? ) defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax . As usual , few favorable reviews were heard for that ever-present marching band of program traders , although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write . What really spooked the crowds along Wall Street , however , was the sudden concern that , whatever the reason , the pool of debt <head> capital </head> is drying up . Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers , rather than the small investor , as their highly margined investments in the `` deal '' stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing .

To the extent that Friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage , the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior . The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings . The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank <head> capital </head> for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate . If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers , and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions . Yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral , but they rode the tiger up all year .

The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover , and it 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the UAL trading halt . Still , the consensus seems almost as wide that one faltering bid is no reason to write down the value of all U.S. business . This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn : the success of Senate Democrats in stalling the <head> capital </head> gains tax cut . The real value of all shares , after all , is directly impacted by the tax on any profits ( all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not `` ordinary income '' ) .

Junk 's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one-day dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19 , 1987 , crash .

But `` an eerie silence pervaded '' the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite `` no active trading , '' says John Lonski , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc .

It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any U.S. <head> carrier </head> with revenues of $ 1 billion or more . So the UAL deal has problems , and the market loses 190 points . Congratulations , Mr. Secretary and Mr. Congressman .

Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors .

The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization : fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; ; clinging to the enemy-Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; ; once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that <head> causes </head> him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . `` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? ? The Trial should have asked the nations .

First intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen .

Ignorance on this point has <head> caused </head> a great deal of needless anxiety , misunderstanding and suspicion . The hymen is , in essence , a fragile membrane that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most female human beings who have not had sex relations .

The intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control .

That is , when first penetration takes place , the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily <head> cause </head> all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain . The advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological . Since it is a purely professional situation , none of the pain is associated with love-making or the beloved .

The long , unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels . Under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases , providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration . Extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall ( the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back ) may <head> cause </head> a great deal of distress in a virgin . But during the same examination , two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall ( the bottom of the vagina in the same position ) without any pain ; ; and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times . These regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse .

Ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride , both physically and psychologically .

The pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital relations and <head> cause </head> her , unconsciously , to make the sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it .

As in the theory of perception , established in psycho-physiology , the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain . But then this theory confesses that it is completely at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain .

Ramsperger says , `` passed on to the brain , and there , by some unexplained process , it <head> causes </head> the mind to have a perception '' . But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? ? As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers -- rather than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location .

The committee 's members are worried what all this free food might do to the economic prospects of Poland 's own farmers . Rep. Gary Ackerman noted that past food aid had harmed farmers in El Salvador and Egypt .

But , barring further drops in the market this week , a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year . Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's gimmick-ridden plan , which still is n't fully implemented . One of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to <head> come </head> about is that , as everyone learned in 1987 , the economy and the market can survive a one-day 508-point tumble . `` Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929 , that we were looking at a recession , '' Rep.

As the 1992 economic integration approaches , Europe 's cultural curators have taken to the ramparts against American `` cultural imperialism , '' threatening to impose quotas against such pop invaders as `` Dallas , '' `` Miami Vice '' and `` L.A.

The most militant opposition to American TV imports has <head> come </head> from French television and movie producers , who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full 60 % of Europe 's TV shows be produced in Europe . So far , the French have failed to win enough broad-based support to prevail . A glance through the television listings and a few twists of the European television dial suggest one reason why .

Since production costs were guaranteed , it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into syndication , as most American programs are .

Analysts immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in months , as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped . Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit , the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ 145.21 billion . That rise <head> came </head> on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy . `` I think the Friday report , combined with the actions of the Fed , weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy , '' said Robert Dederick , chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago . But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers .

Although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations , car prices rose beyond the customary autumn increase . Prices for capital equipment rose a hefty 1.1 % in September , while prices for home electronic equipment fell 1.1 % .

Late Thursday , after the close of trading , the market received what would normally have been a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the 1989-90 Florida orange crop .

However , as expected , Brazil waited for the crop estimate to <head> come </head> out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $ 1.34 a pound from around $ 1.55 . Friday 's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time . It settled with a loss of 4.95 cents at $ 1.3210 a pound .

Next , he continued to court the communists -- many of whom feel betrayed by the left-right coalition 's birth -- by bringing into PASOK a well-respected Communist Party candidate .

After 26 years in prison , Mr. Sisulu , the 77-year-old former secretary-general of the liberation movement , was dropped off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was <head> coming </head> up .

And as the graying men returned to their homes , the ANC , outlawed in South Africa since 1960 and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government , defiantly returned to the streets of the country 's black townships .

The latest provocation : Sony Corp.

In a highly unusual meeting in Sen. DeConcini 's office in April 1987 , the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln .

'' Mr. Keating had <head> complained </head> that the regulators were being too zealous . The notes show that Sen.

The when and how of straightening `` most orthodontic work is done on children between the ages of 10 and 14 , though there have been patients as young as two and as old as 55 '' , says Dr. Brodie .

Orthodontic work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not rigidly , by a system of peridontal membrane with an involved nerve network , to the bone in the jaw ; ; they are not anchored directly to the bone . Abnormal pressure , applied over a period of time , produces a change in the bony deposit , so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided .

A free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can tolerate .

It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream `` foul '' on program trading when the markets decline , while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise . Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks , instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins ?

Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional <head> conditions </head> on the president 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing . The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary .

Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny . There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other . Perhaps none of the unconstitutional <head> conditions </head> contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States . '' This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law , since a one-house resolution could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto . The Supreme Court 's decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional .

Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto . As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives . The excision of unconstitutional <head> conditions </head> in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability . One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers . There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills .

No fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling . But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency . After the 1987 plunge , markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic <head> conditions </head> arose . The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers : If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour ; if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours . The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels .

Investors who bought stock with borrowed money -- that is , `` on margin '' -- may be more worried than most following Friday 's market drop .

Include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings and equipment . Also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be <head> contributed </head> by the family . It may be hard to decide what this labor is worth , but charge something for it . Otherwise , you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor .

One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` I want a word with you , please '' . At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier . Freud probably <head> contributed </head> more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation Of Dreams , Chapter 1 : : As `` a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case , , and what is more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' . Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision .

The thrifts ' lawyers claim that the suits , numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone , should be dismissed as moot because neither the S&amp;Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money to pay judgments . Though the argument may have a common-sense ring to it , even the S&amp;L lawyers concede there 's little precedent to back their position . Still , one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to entertain the notion , and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the <head> defense </head> is permitted under state law . The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC 's massive legal bills , which topped $ 73 million last year . The S&amp;L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate-court ruling in two cases brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings &amp; Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch , best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team .

A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that shareholders ca n't hold corporate officials liable for false sales projections on new products if the news media concurrently revealed substantial information about the product 's flaws . The ruling stems from a 1984 suit filed by shareholders of Apple Computer Inc. , claiming that company officials misled investors about the expected success of the Lisa computer , introduced in 1983 . Lawyers specializing in shareholder suits said they are concerned that use of the `` press <head> defense </head> '' by corporations may become popular as a result of the ruling . According to the suit , Apple officials created public excitement by touting Lisa as an office computer that would revolutionize the workplace and be extremely successful in its first year .

One wife , <head> described </head> by a New York psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly PTA meetings and the Thursday-night neighborhood card parties . Another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis . After every money argument , she rebuffed her husband 's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor .

Marriage manuals and women 's magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax . They began to <head> describe </head> in detail the woman 's capacity for response . In fact , the noted psychologist and sex researcher , Dr. Albert Ellis , has declared flatly that women are `` sexually superior '' to men .

Aerospace earnings sagged 37 % for the quarter and 15 % for the year , largely due to lower B-1B program profit ; the last of the bombers rolled out in April 1988 .

A House-Senate conference approved major portions of a package for more than $ 500 million in economic aid for Poland that relies heavily on $ 240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment . For the Agency for International Development , appropriators approved $ 200 million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program , and total loan guarantees for the Overseas Private Investment Corp. are increased by $ 40 million over fiscal 1989 as part of the same Poland package . The conference approved at least $ 55 million in direct cash and <head> development </head> assistance as well , and though no decision was made , both sides are committed to adding more than $ 200 million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the Bush administration . The agreement on Poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill , which has already provoked veto threats by the White House and is sharply confined under this year 's budget . These fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the Poland package , and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending , the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on U.S. aid to Eastern Europe .

The action on Poland came as the conference separately approved $ 220 million for international population planning activities , an 11 % increase over fiscal 1989 . The House and Senate are divided over whether the United Nations Population Fund will receive any portion of these appropriations , but the size of the increase is itself significant . In a second area of common concern , the world environment , an additional $ 15 million will be provided in <head> development </head> assistance to fund a series of initiatives , related both to global warming and the plight of the African elephant . The sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments , running from an import exemption for a California airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of Panama 's quota of exports to the profitable U.S. market . Panama was stripped of this right because of U.S. differences with the Noriega regime , but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21-month period ending Sept. 30 , 1990 .

An action once universally condemned by all Christian churches and forbidden by the civil law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty .

Rep. Panetta said that OMB 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . ''

Fred Wertheimer -- president of Common Cause , the self-styled citizens lobby -- said Mr. Keating already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona , Alan Cranston of California , John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan ; and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona . Mr. Wertheimer based this on a statement by Mr. Keating that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April : `` One question ... had to <head> do </head> with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause . I want to say in the most forceful way I can : I certainly hope so . '' In a highly unusual meeting in Sen. DeConcini 's office in April 1987 , the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln .

But Sen. McCain says Mr. Keating broke off their friendship abruptly in 1987 , because the senator refused to press the thrift executive 's case as vigorously as Mr. Keating wanted . `` He became very angry at that , left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp , '' Sen. McCain recalls . In July , California newspapers disclosed that Mr. Keating gave $ 850,000 in corporate funds to three tax-exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of Sen. Cranston , who conceded that soliciting the money was `` a pretty stupid thing to <head> do </head> politically . '' In addition , Sen. Cranston received $ 47,000 in campaign donations through Mr. Keating , and the California Democratic party received $ 85,000 in corporate donations for a 1986 get-out-the-vote drive that benefited the senator 's re-election campaign that year . Also in July , Ohio newspapers disclosed $ 200,000 in corporate donations by Mr. Keating to the National Council on Public Policy , a political committee controlled by Sen. Glenn .

Mr. Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation , as was <head> done </head> in the case of former House Speaker James Wright . Wilson Abney , staff director of the ethics panel , would n't comment . Sen. Riegle said he would cooperate with any inquiry , but that his conduct had been `` entirely proper . ''

Sen. McCain said he had been `` deeply concerned '' at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper , but decided it was `` entirely appropriate '' for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent . Sen. Glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and `` I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate Ethics Committee . '' Sen. DeConcini said , `` When all is said and <head> done </head> , I expect to be fully exonerated . '' Sen. Cranston , who had already volunteered his help to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any investigation of Mr. Keating , portrayed his role in 1987 as prodding regulators to act . `` Why did n't the Bank Board act sooner ? '' he said .

The cases quickly went to court , but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand they used . Beginning in 1980 , courts in several states including California and New York decided to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable . Courts made the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same , and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against <head> drug </head> makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales . This has some logic . Drug makers should n't be able to duck liability because people could n't identify precisely which identical drug was used .

Just as all plaintiffs are not alike , it turns out that DES defendants marketed the <head> drugs </head> differently and may have offered different warranties . The ultimate result came in Hymowitz v.

But as Duke University law professor William Van Alstyne notes , by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable in New York for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in California .

But courts quickly tumbled down a slippery slope . Just as all plaintiffs are not alike , it turns out that DES defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties . The ultimate result came in Hymowitz v. Lilly , where the highest New York court expanded the market-share approach for the first time to say that <head> drug </head> makers that could prove Mindy Hymowitz 's mother did n't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages . But as Duke University law professor William Van Alstyne notes , by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable in New York for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in California . Despite the Supreme Court 's refusal to hear the case , there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants .

William R. Breakey M.D. Pamela J. Fischer M.D. Department of Psychiatry Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Baltimore A study by Tulane Prof. James Wright says homelessness is due to a complex array of problems , with the common thread of poverty . The study shows that nearly 40 % of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only 25 % of the homeless exhibits some combination of <head> drug </head> , alcohol and mental problems . According to Dr. Wright , homelessness is `` simultaneously a housing problem , an employment problem , a demographic problem , a problem of social disaffiliation , a mental health problem , a family violence problem , a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending , a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family , and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level .

Although the average citizen is probably not harmed too much from Washington 's rhetorical war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial leveraging , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm . Any such attempt to distinguish `` good debt '' from `` bad debt , '' or to draw the line at a particular industry , such as the airlines , is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general . Far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against <head> drugs </head> , Panama and the deficit , all of them parades that seem never to end .

The thing to lose sleep over is what people , having concluded that we are weaker than we are , are likely to do about it . The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead .

To the extent , then , that declining U.S. prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern .

He predicted that inflation will moderate next year , saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide . But Dirk Van Dongen , president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors , said that last month 's rise `` is n't as bad an omen '' as the 0.9 % figure suggests . `` If you <head> examine </head> the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , '' he explained . Passenger car prices jumped 3.8 % in September , after climbing 0.5 % in August and declining in the late spring and summer . Many analysts said the September increase was a one-time event , coming as dealers introduced their 1990 models .

All the officials on the case seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as Bridget was concerned , although records in police files contain many reports of servants who have murdered their employers .

The actions of Bridget should be <head> examined </head> , since she was there and opportunity did exist , if only to establish her innocence . There are also other factors that require closer examination . The legend as it exists in Fall River today always includes the solemn assurance that Bridget returned to Ireland after the trial with a `` big bundle '' of cash which Lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut .

Program trading itself , according to many academics who have studied it , is merely caught in the middle of this battle , unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace . The evidence indicates that program trading did n't , in fact , cause the market 's sharp fall on Oct. 13 , though it may have exacerbated it . On one side of this power struggle stand the forces in ascendency on Wall Street -- the New Guard -- consisting of high-tech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms , their pension fund clients with immense pools of money , and the traders at the fast-growing Chicago futures <head> exchanges </head> . These are the main proponents of program trading . Defending their ramparts are Wall Street 's Old Guard -- the traditional , stock-picking money managers , tens of thousands of stock brokers , the New York Stock Exchange 's listed companies and the clannish floor traders , known as specialists , who make markets in their stocks .

The Old Guard 's assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based , in part because some Old Guard members feel their very livelihood is at stake . Some , such as traditional money manager Neuberger &amp; Berman , have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators `` stop the numbers racket on Wall Street . '' Big Board stock specialists , in a bold palace revolt , began shortly after Oct. 13 to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the Big Board to have them pressure the <head> exchange </head> to ban program trading . Charles Wohlstetter , the chairman of Contel Corp. who is rallying other CEOs to the anti-program trading cause , says he has received `` countless '' letters offering support . `` They said universally , without a single exception : Do n't even compromise .

At Kidder , a unit of General Electric Co. , and other big brokerage firms , stockbrokers battle their own firm 's program traders a few floors away . Corporations like Contel denounce program trading , yet Contel has in the past hired pension fund managers like Bankers Trust Co. that are also big program traders . The Big Board -- the nation 's premier stock <head> exchange </head> -- is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives . Its entrenched 49 stock specialists firms are fighting tooth and nail against programs .

Why does this large hypothetical seller trade in Chicago instead of New York ? Perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade . In a competitive market , this investor has many ways to execute his transactions , and he will have more alternatives ( both foreign and domestic ) if his volume is profitable for an <head> exchange </head> to handle . If not Chicago , then in New York ; if not the U.S. , then overseas . Volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage , but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity .

The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels .

As liquidity on that market weakened , prices fell sharply .

At 3:30 , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington , the futures <head> exchanges </head> reopened . Futures trading , however , was halted altogether at 3:45 , after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points , which is the daily limit for price declines .

To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none .

It 's time for the <head> exchanges </head> and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open . Let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250-point decline .

The need for hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets .

The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected <head> exchanges </head> acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies . Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission ( which , with the SEC , regulates the Chicago stock-index markets ) be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary .

Share prices plummeted across Europe yesterday in response to Friday 's New York sell-off , but some issues staged a late comeback after Wall Street opened without another rout . European investors have further reason for optimism today , after the U.S. rebound . The Frankfurt Stock Exchange , which closed before the New York <head> exchanges </head> opened , was the hardest hit of the major European markets , with the DAX Index dropping 12.8 % . In London , prices plummeted in early trading and were off as much as 9 % before coming back strong after the New York opening to close down only 3.2 % . West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said , `` In my view , the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly .

The DAX Index of 30 West German blue chips plunged 12.8 % , a one-day record , wiping out the summer 's gains . The index closed at 1385.72 , down 203.56 points . By comparison , two years ago on Black Monday , the new index would have dropped 9.4 % , according to a projection by the <head> exchange </head> . Investors may have reacted so strongly to Friday 's U.S. stock market loss because they had vivid memories of the Frankfurt exchange 's losing 35 % of its value in the 1987 crash and its wake .

The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets . But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended .

Those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels .

Therefore , the scholar , as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years , will be mindful of two facts . 1 ) Most of the legends that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at all . 2 ) The concept that an `` American national folklore '' <head> exists </head> is itself probably another propagandistic legend . Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of people preserve , vary and recreate through oral transmission . It has come to mean myths , legends , tales , songs , proverbs , riddles , superstitions , rhymes and such literary forms of expression .

Though it may <head> exist </head> in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter .

Instead of Catholics ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many Non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed .

In 1920 , the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together with the grave dangers -- physical , moral , and religious -- thereby incurred , and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race '' . Denouncing the view that the sexual union is an end in itself , the Conference declared : `` We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of Christian marriage . One is the primary purpose for which marriage <head> exists </head> , namely , the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children ; ; the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control '' . The Conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives . In 1930 , the Lambeth Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances , contraception might be morally legitimate .

Our society has `` emancipated '' the woman , giving her new independence and new authority . It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role . `` The sexual relationship does not <head> exist </head> in a vacuum '' , declares Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone , medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and author of the recent book , Release From Sexual Tensions . `` It reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself . A world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual relationships in which wives are more self-assertive , too '' .

`` As long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex , it makes little difference if one or the other dominates '' , Dr. Calderone declares . `` The important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment '' . Other experts say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner <head> exists </head> for longer than a brief period , it is likely to shake the marriage . And just as domination today often begins with the wife , so the cure generally must lie with the husband . `` To get a marriage back where it belongs '' , comments Dr. Schillinger of the Lincoln Institute , `` the husband must take some very basic steps .

In regard to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to <head> explain </head> , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . At any rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to that extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it .

At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier . Freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation Of Dreams , Chapter 1 : : As `` a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case , , and what is more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to <head> explain </head> nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' . Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities .

The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support . A `` mental image '' subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought , or consciously in light sleep , is actually not an image at all but is comprised of realities , viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream , but within the depths of the fourth dimension . Dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory <head> explaining </head> their basic mystery and all its components , including that weird feeling of deja vue , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem . As in the theory of perception , established in psycho-physiology , the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain . But then this theory confesses that it is completely at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain .

Since the psychiatric interview , like any other interview , depends on communication , it is significant to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience .

Interestingly enough -- although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman -- when groups of them began playing back interviews , they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques ; ; almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape , <head> expressed </head> some desire to take the whole thing over again . Yet , in spite of this , intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that , in the first five minutes of an initial interview , the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just what 's wrong with him ; ; to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen . Naturally , the patient does not say , `` I hate my father '' , or `` Sibling rivalry is what bugs me '' .

MANY AFFLUENT people place personal success and money above family . At least that 's what a survey by Ernst &amp; Young and Yankelovich , Clancy , Shulman indicates . Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly <head> felt </head> the need to be successful in their jobs , while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families . Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group . Unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded the super-rich .

Next , he continued to court the communists -- many of whom <head> feel </head> betrayed by the left-right coalition 's birth -- by bringing into PASOK a well-respected Communist Party candidate . For balance , and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes , he managed to attract a former New Democracy Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. Mitsotakis . Thus PASOK heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal-stench , but also with `` seals of approval '' from representatives of its harshest accusers .

Since interviewing is the basic therapeutic and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry , the recording of interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of Redstone proportions in new research and training . Some of the earliest recordings , made in the 1940 's demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track , whereas written records of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which -- if they were at all discernible in print -- were picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts . In a general way , psychiatrists were able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always <head> felt </head> -- that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic , that such things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not necessarily by words . At a minimum , recording -- usually on tape , which is now in wide professional use -- brings the psychiatric interview alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists . Newest to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level .

Within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent to the therapist that `` everybody '' truthfully refers to the woman 's husband .

Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence . 1 ) Every age rewrites the events of its history in terms of what should have been , creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions . What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation <head> feels </head> must have occurred . 2 ) As a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others , it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness . Its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account for group actions , to provide a focal point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification .

The real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism of this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself . In regard to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , <head> feel </head> personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . At any rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to that extent .

That is one thing the experiments are designed to find out . So , after the sitting has been held , several readings at one time are mailed , and the distant sitter ( whose name or whose communicator 's name was given to the medium ) must mark each little item as Correct ( Hit ) , Incorrect ( Miss ) , Doubtful , or Especially Significant ( applying to him and , he <head> feels </head> , not to anyone else ) .

That is one thing the experiments are designed to find out . So , after the sitting has been held , several readings at one time are mailed , and the distant sitter ( whose name or whose communicator 's name was given to the medium ) must mark each little item as Correct ( Hit ) , Incorrect ( Miss ) , Doubtful , or Especially Significant ( applying to him and , he feels , not to anyone else ) . He is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he <head> feels </head> is actually his . All these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated , by adding up the Hits and Significants , with the weight placed on those in the sitter 's own reading . That is , if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him , the total experimental score falls .

Now when , so to speak , the cream has been skimmed off , and the items in the successful categories separated out , the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated `` cream '' , where the sensitive is at her best . Mediumistic impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses . `` I <head> feel </head> cold '' , the medium says , or `` My leg aches '' , `` My head is heavy '' . Or perhaps she hears words or sounds : `` There 's such a noise of loud machinery '' , or `` I hear a child crying '' , or `` He says we 're all here and glad to see you '' . Maybe an entire scene comes into consciousness , with action and motion , or a static view : `` a house under a pine tree , with a little stone path going up to the door '' .

Thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed -- the one place he can still be champion . If his on-the-job problems work out , he may return to his old pattern . Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she <head> feels </head> age creeping up . On the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable . Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted , flattered or coaxed , simply because she needs her ego lifted .

At the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel to settle at $ 2.375 a bushel . Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought .

It is n't clear , however , who would win a waiting game . Although U.S. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought , the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins . Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn <head> futures </head> contracts -- only to see little appreciation . `` The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped , '' said Bill Biedermann , Allendale Inc. research director . Although much of this country 's export corn goes to New Orleans by barge , it is possible for exporters to sidestep the Mississippi River by shipping a larger-than-normal amount of corn by train to the port .

But its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems . In other commodity markets yesterday : ENERGY : Crude oil <head> futures </head> prices increased in moderate trading , but much of the action was in heating oil . Prices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged in a fire , tightening an already tight European market . Heating oil for November delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon , up one cent on the New York Mercantile Exchange .

Reasons for the walkout , the analyst said , included a number of procedural issues , such as a right to strike . The analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks . In the case of copper , he said , the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for <head> futures </head> contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal . Also contributing to the firmness in copper , the analyst noted , was a report by Chicago purchasing agents , which precedes the full purchasing agents ' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold . The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago 's October index rose to 51.6 % after three previous months of readings below 50 % .

Program trading itself , according to many academics who have studied it , is merely caught in the middle of this battle , unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace . The evidence indicates that program trading did n't , in fact , cause the market 's sharp fall on Oct. 13 , though it may have exacerbated it . On one side of this power struggle stand the forces in ascendency on Wall Street -- the New Guard -- consisting of high-tech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms , their pension fund clients with immense pools of money , and the traders at the fast-growing Chicago <head> futures </head> exchanges . These are the main proponents of program trading . Defending their ramparts are Wall Street 's Old Guard -- the traditional , stock-picking money managers , tens of thousands of stock brokers , the New York Stock Exchange 's listed companies and the clannish floor traders , known as specialists , who make markets in their stocks .

Defending their ramparts are Wall Street 's Old Guard -- the traditional , stock-picking money managers , tens of thousands of stock brokers , the New York Stock Exchange 's listed companies and the clannish floor traders , known as specialists , who make markets in their stocks . So far , Wall Street 's Old Guard seems to be winning the program-trading battle , successfully mobilizing public and congressional opinion to bludgeon their tormentors . The Chicago Mercantile Exchange , a major <head> futures </head> marketplace , yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market , and the Big Board is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading . Stung by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a gigantic crapshoot , almost all the big investment banking houses have abandoned index arbitrage , a common form of program trading , for their own accounts in the past few days . A few , such as giant Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. , now refuse even to do index arbitrage trades for clients .

Program trading money managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country , and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has wedded them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them . What 's more , the last time major Wall Street firms said they were getting out of program trading -- in the aftermath of the 1987 crash -- they waited a few months and then sneaked back into it . Even some members of the Old Guard , despite their current advantage , seem to be conceding that the <head> future </head> belongs with the New Guard . Last week , Robert M. Bradley , one of the Big Board 's most respected floor traders and head of a major traders ' organization , surrendered . He sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. in which he said the Big Board is too focused on machines , rather than people .

`` Just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to beg the regulators for protection . '' For all the furor , there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage , the most controversial type of computer-assisted program trading . Like other forms of arbitrage , it merely seeks to take advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product -- in this case , a basket of stocks -- in different markets -- in this case the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago <head> futures </head> markets . That divergence is what stock index traders seek . When it occurs , the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks ( such as the 500 stocks that constitute the Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 stock index ) in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market ; they lock in the difference in price as profit .

Program trading critics also want the Federal Reserve Board , rather than the <head> futures </head> industry , to set such margins . Futures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active . Higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell , they say .

Another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an `` uptick rule '' a reform instituted after the Great Crash of 1929 that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices , namely short sellers . The Big Board 's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price . But in 1986 , program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations , to make it easier to link the stock and <head> futures </head> markets . A reinstatement of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably . Program traders argue that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the `` pricing efficiency '' of the futures and stock markets .

Index arbitrage is a common form of program trading . As usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept : Two separate markets in different locations , trading basically the same widgets , ca n't trade them for long at prices that are widely different . In index arbitrage , the widget is the S&amp;P 500 , and its price is constantly compared between the <head> futures </head> market in Chicago and the stock markets largely in New York . To profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity , someone who owns the S&amp;P 500 widget in New York must sell it and replace it with a cheaper S&amp;P 500 widget in Chicago . If the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the S&amp;P 500 index , he is likely to remain fully invested at all times .

The fact that a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers fail to beat the S&amp;P 500 may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue . As more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy , these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and , eventually , eliminated . The current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the S&amp;P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the <head> futures </head> market . The New York Stock Exchange 's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors ' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares . So if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget , how did `` program trading '' evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers ?

Arbitrage does n't cause volatility ; it responds to it . Think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for S&amp;P 500 stocks -- usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in Chicago . A large investor will likely cause the <head> futures </head> market to decline when he sells his futures . Arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from Chicago to New York , while functioning as a buyer in Chicago . The start of the whole process is the key - someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets to make widget prices move .

Eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising , creating more volatility instead of less .

A free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can tolerate . In point of fact , volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today . Periods before the advent of <head> futures </head> or program trading were often more volatile , usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change ( 1973-75 , 1937-40 , and 1928-33 for example ) . It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream `` foul '' on program trading when the markets decline , while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise . Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks , instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins ?

In a recent report , the Institute of Medicine pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness , others may be a consequence of it , and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter .

It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the <head> futures </head> markets and the options markets , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively . Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them . It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers .

Let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250-point decline . The need for hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets . The new circuit breakers , if they are to be applied at all , will require that <head> futures </head> and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open . The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies . Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission ( which , with the SEC , regulates the Chicago stock-index markets ) be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary .

Concerning your Sept. 19 article `` Wall Street Firms Link Analysts ' Pay to Performance , '' I 'm delighted that Wall Street is finally tuning in to the hard , cold facts of the real working world . If the firms are serious , however , why limit the practice to the poor , maligned analysts whose ability to see into the <head> future </head> is fragile at best ? Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force , and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year ? That should stop a lot of account-churning , and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense .

Not really insurance , this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S&amp;P <head> futures </head> contracts . In its severest test , the $ 60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash did n't work , as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected .

For both Thomson and British Aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries ; and Middle East sales , a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports , have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices .

General Motors Corp. , in a series of moves that angered union officials in the U.S. and Canada , has signaled that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle-making capacity .

GM is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker 's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade .

The central weakness of the `` scandals '' debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks . The coalition government tried to show that PASOK ministers had received hefty sums for OKing the purchase of F-16 Fighting Falcon and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft , produced by the U.S.based General Dynamics Corp. and France 's Avions Marcel Dassault , respectively . Naturally , neither General Dynamics nor Dassault could be expected to hamper its prospective <head> future </head> dealings by making disclosures of sums paid ( or not ) to various Greek officials for services rendered . So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter : PASOK , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou 's expense . But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help PASOK regain power , Mr. Papandreou should never be underestimated .

A further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other , more sweeping changes proposed -- but not implemented -- after the last crash . Most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force , which analyzed the 1987 crash , would be revived -- especially because that group 's chairman is now the Treasury secretary . The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and <head> futures </head> markets . But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended . Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` hot-line '' communications among exchanges .

In October 1987 , just after the market drop , Washington was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated . Over the next year that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market players time to pause and reconsider positions . In addition , limits were placed on computer-driven trading , and steps were taken to better link the stock and <head> futures </head> markets . Few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated . At the outset the prime target was program trading , which was much discussed but little understood on Capitol Hill .

There were also calls to strip the stock markets of `` derivative '' products , such as stock-index <head> futures </head> and options , which Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin , for example , likened to `` barnacles attached to the basic market . '' And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists , or market makers .

The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies . In May 1988 , the Working Group , made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve , the Treasury , the Securities and Exchange Commission , and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , finally endorsed only circuit breakers . After several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and <head> futures </head> markets , circuit breakers were set in place , with the most notable suspending trading after 250 and 400 point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . Privately , some free marketeers dismissed such mechanisms as sops to interventionists . After all , this free-market argument went , the Dow only dropped more than 250 points once this century .

But the unconditional release of the seven leaders , who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the ANC , is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing . `` The government can never put the ANC back into the bottle again , '' said Cassim Saloojee , a veteran anti-apartheid activist on hand to welcome Mr. Sisulu . `` Things have <head> gone </head> too far for the government to stop them now . There 's no turning back . '' There was certainly no stopping the tide of ANC emotion last night , when hundreds of people jammed into the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto for what became the first ANC rally in the country in 30 years .

But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country .

As the days <head> go </head> by , the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency . If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC , the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest . If it does , the large number of right-wing whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands .

The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II . Article II places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. . It also empowers the president to make recess appointments , without Senate approval : `` The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate , by <head> granting </head> Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session . '' Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides : `` No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person . '' Thus , with one brief passage in an appropriations bill , Congress repeals the president 's power to make recess appointments under Article II .

Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States . '' This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law , since a one-house resolution could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto . The Supreme Court 's decision in INS v. Chadha <head> held </head> that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional . President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives . If President Bush fails to do so in his first year , he will invite Congress , for the remainder of his presidency , to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes .

Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . Absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify . Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he <head> held </head> a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime . Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the Fifth Amendment shield against self-incrimination .

And for six years , NBC , ABC and CBS have negotiated with Hollywood studios in a futile attempt to change that . But with foreign companies snapping up U.S. movie studios , the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever . They <head> hope </head> the foreign deals will divide the Hollywood opposition and prod Congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air . Even network executives , however , admit privately that victory -- either in Congress or in talks with the studios -- is highly doubtful any time soon . And so the networks also are pushing for new ways to sidestep the `` fin-syn '' provisions , known formally as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules .

That became clear last week with the disclosure that National Broadcasting Co. , backed by the deep pockets of parent General Electric Co. , had tried to help fund Qintex Australia Ltd.

`` I wonder what Walter Cronkite will think of the Sony\/Columbia Broadcast System Trinitron Evening News with Dan Rather broadcast exclusively from Tokyo , '' wrote J.B. Holston , an NBC vice president , in a commentary in last week 's issue of Broadcasting magazine . In his article , Mr. Holston , who was in Europe last week and unavailable , complained that the `` archaic restraints '' in fin-syn rules have `` contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non-U.S. enterprises . '' ( He did n't mention that NBC , in the meantime , was <head> hoping </head> to assist Australia 's Qintex in buying An NBC spokesman counters that Mr. Holston 's lament was `` entirely consistent '' with NBC plans because the U.S. rules would limit NBC 's involvement in the Qintex deal so severely as to be `` light years away from the type of unrestrained deals available to Sony -- and everyone else except the three networks . '' The Big Three 's drumbeat for deregulation began intensifying in the summer when the former Time Inc. went ahead with plans to acquire Warner .

Fred Wertheimer -- president of Common Cause , the self-styled citizens lobby -- said Mr. Keating already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona , Alan Cranston of California , John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan ; and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona . Mr. Wertheimer based this on a statement by Mr. Keating that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April : `` One question ... had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause . I want to say in the most forceful way I can : I certainly <head> hope </head> so . '' In a highly unusual meeting in Sen. DeConcini 's office in April 1987 , the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln . According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting , the regulators said Lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors ' federally insured money and was `` a ticking time bomb . ''

The ad interim coalition government that emerged from post-electoral hagglings was , in essence , little more than the ill-conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation : On one side , the center-right New Democracy Party , headed by Constantine Mitsotakis .

Udall argues that Interior affairs should cover a great deal more than dams and wildlife preserves . After promoting Frost 's appearance at the Inauguration , he persuaded the poet to return several months later to give a reading to a select audience of Cabinet members , members of Congress , and other Washington notables gathered in the State Department auditorium .

His Ideas in this respect , however , sometimes arouse critical response . One tempest was stirred up last March when Udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue of William Jennings Bryan , sculpted by the late Gutzon Borglum , would be sent `` on indefinite loan '' to Salem , Illinois , Bryan 's birthplace .

But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency . After the 1987 plunge , markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose . The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers : If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one <head> hour </head> ; if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours . The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels . It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic .

Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions . It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open . Let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an <head> hour </head> after a 250-point decline . The need for hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets . The new circuit breakers , if they are to be applied at all , will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open .

Other Hong Kong manufacturers expect their results to <head> improve </head> only slightly this year from 1988 . Besides the lack of a fast-selling product , they cite the continued dominance of the U.S. market by Nintendo Entertainment System , an expensive video game made by Nintendo Co. of Japan .

The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air .

Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona .

By some measures , metropolitan Denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years .

It follows that proposals like Nunn-McCurdy , whose benefits to enrollees are worth some $ 17,500 a year , do not qualify . There is a rationale for such bills : Federal subsidies to college students amount to `` a GI Bill without the GI '' ; arguably those benefits should be earned , not given . But the earnings exceed by 20 % the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time <head> jobs </head> . Why call that service ? 3 . Encouragement is fine ; compulsion is not .

With a tax-free $ 10,000 voucher payment at the end of each year , the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to $ 17,500 a year . Mind you , most of `` the volunteers '' would be unskilled 17 - to 18-year-olds , some not even high school graduates , and many saving money by living at home . They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of <head> jobs </head> and perhaps supporting families . As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system , so the national-service devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of `` give in order to get . '' Opposition to national service from the Pentagon , which wants to protect its own recruitment process , also led to the military-service option being dropped .

The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF -- traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts -- is stirring controversy in Western Europe 's defense industry . Most threatened by closer British Aerospace-Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals , including Matra S.A. in France and Britain 's General Electric Co. PLC .

The venture 's importance for Thomson is great . Thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans . The European defense industry is consolidating ; for instance , West Germany 's Siemens AG recently <head> joined </head> GEC in a takeover of Britain 's Plessey Co. , and Daimler-Benz agreed to buy Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b .

To justify 50-50 ownership of the planned venture , Thomson would make a cash payment to British Aerospace .

Lucy Upton was graduated from the Salem High School when few colleges , only Oberlin and Elmira , were open to women ; ; and she had an appetite for learning that could not be denied . A picture of her in high school comes from a younger schoolmate , Albert S. Flint , friend of her brother Winslow , and later , like Winslow , a noted astronomer . He recalled Lucy , as `` a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly through the boys ' study hall to <head> join </head> the class in Greek in the little recitation room beyond '' . The study of Greek was the distinctive mark of boys destined to go to college , and Lucy Upton too expected to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men .

Seven hundred miles south of York Factory , at `` the Forks '' of the Red and the Assiniboine , twenty-three men located a settlement in August 1812 .

Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to Red River where they were to serve as a military force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders ' empire .

Few people privy to the talks expect the studios to budge .

Studios are `` powerless '' to get shows in prime-time lineups and <head> keep </head> them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales , he contends . And that 's why the rules , for the most part , must stay in place , he says .

U.S. OFFICIALS MOVED to head off any repeat of Black Monday today following Friday 's plunge in stock prices . Fed Chairman Greenspan signaled that the central bank was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system to prevent a financial crisis . Other U.S. and foreign officials also mapped out plans , though they <head> kept </head> their moves quiet to avoid making the financial markets more jittery . Friday 's sell-off was triggered by the collapse of UAL 's buy-out plan and a big rise in producer prices . The Dow Jones industrials skidded 190.58 , to 2569.26 .

Friday 's 190-point plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash , and mechanisms have been put in place to <head> keep </head> markets more orderly . Still , the lesson is about the same : On Friday the 13th , the market was spooked by Washington . The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover , and it 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the UAL trading halt .

The shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp. , which created its U.S. retailing empire with junk financing . Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdales department-store chain up for sale . Now , dozens of corporations , including Ethan Allen , TW Services and York International , that are counting on at least $ 7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to <head> keep </head> their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat , may never get the money . `` The music has stopped playing , '' says Michael Harkins , a principal in the investment firm of Levy Harkins . `` You 've either got a chair or you do n't .

Prices of municipals , investment-grade corporates and mortgage-backed bonds also rose , but lagged behind their Treasury counterparts . Mortgage securities rose in hectic trading , with most of the activity concentrated in Government National Mortgage Association 9 % coupon securities , the most liquid mortgage issue .

As with other plastic in Britain 's high-interest-rate environment , the Labor card , administered by Co-operative Bank , carries a stiff ( in this case , 29.8 % ) annual rate on the unpaid balance . China 's year-long austerity program has achieved some successes in harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an alarming drain on state budgets . The official China Daily said retail prices of non-staple foods have n't risen since last December but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in <head> keeping </head> prices down . The State Statistical Bureau found that more than 1 billion yuan ( $ 270 million ) was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies . The newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to `` become very unreasonable '' and reduce needed funds for investment in the `` already difficult state budget .

The Fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions .

Rather , it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s , along with smallpox . It is back with us again , in the form of legislation to pay volunteers under a `` National and Community Service Act , '' a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall . Why does the national-service virus <head> keep </head> coming back ? Perhaps it is because utopian nostalgia evokes both military experience and the social gospel .

Those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long-term aim of many national-service backers , despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion .

But the virus was <head> kept </head> alive in sociology departments until a couple of years ago , when it again was let loose .

Opposition to national service from the Pentagon , which wants to protect its own recruitment process , also led to the military-service option being dropped . Clearly , a new rationale for national service had to be cooked up . What better place to turn than Sen. Edward Kennedy 's Labor Committee , that great stove of government expansionism , where many a stagnant pot of porridge is <head> kept </head> on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle cuisine ? In this case , the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle : a demonstration project for educational aid ( particularly satisfying to the DLC and Sen. Sam Nunn ) , a similar demonstration program for youth conservation ( a la Sen. Chris Dodd ) , a competitive grants program to states to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects ( a Kennedy specialty ) , a community service work-study program for students ( pleasing to the palate of Sen.

In regard to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann <head> kept </head> trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . At any rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to that extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it .

Under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases , providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration . Extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall ( the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back ) may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin . But during the same examination , two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall ( the bottom of the vagina in the same position ) without any pain ; ; and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is <head> kept </head> downward at all times .

Back in the 1920s , the play and movie versions of `` Abie 's Irish Rose '' made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author , Anne Nichols , lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain . And it has remained there , as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom called `` Bridget Loves Bernie , '' whose sole distinction was that it <head> led </head> to the real-life marriage of Meredith Baxter and David Birney . Clearly , the question with `` Chicken Soup '' is not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will simmer at all . So far , the bubbles have been few and far between .

Worries about China came just as Hong Kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies , Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc .

There was certainly no stopping the tide of ANC emotion last night , when hundreds of people jammed into the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto for what became the first ANC rally in the country in 30 years . Deafening chants of `` ANC '' and `` Umkhonto we Sizwe '' shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the ANC would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts , including the armed struggle . And they called on the government to release Nelson Mandela , the ANC 's <head> leading </head> figure , who was jailed with them and remains in prison . Without him , said Mr. Sisulu , the freeing of the others `` is only a half-measure . '' President F.W. de Klerk released the ANC men -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress , a rival liberation group -- as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government .

If it does , the large number of right-wing whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands .

The government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships <head> leads </head> to increased anti-government protests and violence ; if it does , Pretoria will use this as a reason to keep Mr. Mandela behind bars . Pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place : for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government . In addition , the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the ANC and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment .

In a related development , the news-weekly , for the fourth year in a row , said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in 1990 ; a full , four-color page in the magazine costs about $ 120,000 . However , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , according to Richard Heinemann , Time associate publisher . Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that <head> maintaining </head> artificially high , and expensive , circulations is the way to draw advertisers . In recent years , Reader 's Digest , New York Times Co. 's McCall 's , and most recently News Corp.

Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper-competitive world of magazine news-weeklies .

They discovered that , although 42 per cent of a sample of Catholic students and 15 per cent of the Protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion , only 8 per cent of the Jewish students had this conviction . The most important aims of the Jewish students were as follows : to make the world a better place to live in -- 30 per cent ; ; to get happiness for yourself -- 28 per cent ; ; and financial independence -- 21 per cent . Nevertheless , most of the teen-agers I interviewed believed in <head> maintaining </head> their Jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple . However , they were hostile to Jewish Orthodoxy , professing to believe in Judaism `` but in a moderate way '' .

While population at Fort Garry increased rapidly , from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840 , economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate .

The Company <head> maintained </head> a store at which products of England could be purchased and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain from trading in furs . Despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs . In June 1845 , the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20 per cent duty on imports via Hudson 's Bay which were viewed as aimed at the `` very vitals of the Company 's trade and power '' .

Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year .

Rep. Panetta said that OMB 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . ''

Government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a Monday market meltdown -- but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet . Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones , making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in October 1987 , if the action were <head> needed </head> to prevent a financial crisis . And at the Treasury , Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David Mullins carefully analyzed data on the Friday market plunge . But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters .

But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior . It should also encourage service -- preferably by all classes and all ages . Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the U.S. , should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local convictions about which tasks most <head> need </head> doing . 4 . Good programs are not cheap . Enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done cheaply : forest fires fought , housing rehabilitated , students tutored , day-care centers staffed .

If we want to support students , we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more scholarships based on something called `` scholarship , '' rather than on the government 's idea of `` service .

Will national service , in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted ?

However , this does not mean that a child 's teeth or jaws must necessarily resemble those of someone in his family .

For 20 years , federal rules have barred the three major television networks from sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest-growing parts of the television business . And for six years , NBC , ABC and CBS have <head> negotiated </head> with Hollywood studios in a futile attempt to change that . But with foreign companies snapping up U.S. movie studios , the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever . They hope the foreign deals will divide the Hollywood opposition and prod Congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air .

CNN wants to change its viewers ' habits . Its watchers are , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel-zapping `` grazers '' and news junkies , who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN , according to audience research . That 's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast <head> networks </head> . The brief attention viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable-TV channels .

It focused on building up its news bureaus around the world , so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other <head> networks </head> . It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called `` Daybreak , '' `` Daywatch , '' `` Newsday , '' and `` Newsnight , '' but the shows varied little in content , personality or look .

Hence , NBC might be able to take , say , a 5 % stake in a company such as MGM\/UA . If the transaction raised objections , the studio 's syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the <head> network </head> does n't have a direct stake . But such convolutions would still block the networks from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication . Under current rules , even when a network fares well with a 100%-owned series -- ABC , for example , made a killing in broadcasting its popular crime\/comedy `` Moonlighting '' -- it is n't allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local stations .

We have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know about the earth 's interior , for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled . These waves have shown that 1,800 miles below the surface a liquid core begins , and that it , in turn , has a solid inner core . Earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface , but they do not <head> occur </head> at greater depths . Two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts . ( 1 ) As far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking , as rigid surface rocks do .

In this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all of us grope continually .

The famous author tells us of the strange incident in Something About Myself . One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` I want a word with you , please '' . At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had <head> occurred </head> to him in a dream six weeks earlier . Freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation Of Dreams , Chapter 1 : : As `` a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case , , and what is more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' .

Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers . At the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel to settle at $ 2.375 a bushel . Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet <head> orders </head> because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought . With the harvest winding down , however , some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver . Farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices .

One railroad , for example , is already increasing its grain hauling service from Indiana to Baltimore . And it is n't clear that the Soviet Union will stay on its record buying pace . The Soviet <head> orders </head> were compressed into the month of October because of delays . The Soviet Union usually begins buying U.S. crops earlier in the fall . But its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems .

Lentjes ' product mix of specialized boilers and pipes provides a good fit with its own Lurgi G.m.b . H. plant engineering unit , the company said .

Lentjes had 1988 sales of 800 million marks ( $ 434.4 million ) and has a current <head> order </head> backlog of 2.5 billion marks . The sale comes in place of a planned initial public offering of Lentjes stock . A plan to bring the stock to market before year end apparently was upset by the recent weakness of Frankfurt share prices .

Several moves were taken following the October 1987 crash to coordinate -- and sometimes deliberately disconnect -- the stock and futures markets in times of heightened volatility . On the Big Board , a `` side car '' is put into effect when the S&amp;P futures rise or fall 12 points . The side car routes program trades into a special computer file that scans for imbalances of buy and sell <head> orders </head> . On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , S&amp;P 500 futures are not allowed to fall further than 12 points from the previous day 's close for half an hour . If , when trading resumes , the S&amp;P futures fall 30 points from the previous day 's close , a one-hour trading halt takes effect .

In the Treasury market , investors paid scant attention to the day 's economic reports , which for the most part provided a mixed view of the economy . `` Whether you thought the economy was growing weak or holding steady , yesterday 's economic indicators did n't change your opinion , '' said Charles Lieberman , a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp . The government reported that <head> orders </head> for manufactured goods were essentially unchanged in September while construction spending was slightly lower . Both indicators were viewed as signs that the nation 's industrial sector is growing very slowly , if at all . A survey by the Federal Reserve 's 12 district banks and the latest report by the National Association of Purchasing Management blurred that picture of the economy .

Like other forms of arbitrage , it merely seeks to take advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product -- in this case , a basket of stocks -- in different markets -- in this case the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago futures markets . That divergence is what stock index traders seek . When it occurs , the traders place <head> orders </head> via computers to buy the basket of stocks ( such as the 500 stocks that constitute the Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 stock index ) in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market ; they lock in the difference in price as profit . Such program trades , which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock , occur in a matter of seconds . A program trade of $ 5 million of stock typically earns a razor-thin profit of $ 25,000 .

The son of a specialist and once one himself , Mr. Phelan has nonetheless been striving -- with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so much -- to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets . Meanwhile , specialists ' trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stock-market volatility . `` When the sell programs hit , you can hear the <head> order </head> printers start to go '' on the Big Board trading floor , says one specialist there . `` The buyers walk away , and the specialist is left alone '' as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks , he contends .

The fact that a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers fail to beat the S&amp;P 500 may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue . As more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy , these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and , eventually , eliminated . The current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell <head> order </head> in the actual stocks that make up the S&amp;P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market . The New York Stock Exchange 's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors ' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares . So if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget , how did `` program trading '' evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers ?

Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations . Typically , these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations . Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing <head> orders </head> to any cost-benefit scrutiny . There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other . Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States .

Inland Steel Industries Inc. expects to report that third-quarter earnings dropped more than 50 % from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs . In the second quarter , the steelmaker had net income of $ 45.3 million or $ 1.25 a share , including a pretax charge of $ 17 million related to the settlement of a suit , on sales of $ 1.11 billion . The company said normal seasonal softness and lost <head> orders </head> caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by 200,000 tons in the latest quarter , compared with the second quarter . At the same time , the integrated-steel business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses , as well as higher labor costs under its new contract . The service-center business was hurt by reduced margins and start-up costs associated with its Joseph T. Ryerson &amp; Son unit .

For one thing , even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last , tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into 1990 , the analysts say . And if rain does n't fall soon across many of the Great Plains ' wheat-growing areas , yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced , further squeezing supplies . Also supporting prices are expectations that the Soviet Union will place substantial buying <head> orders </head> over the next few months . By next May 31 , stocks of U.S. wheat to be carried over into the next season -- before the winter wheat now being planted is harvested -- are projected to drop to 443 million bushels . That would be the lowest level since the early 1970s .

Article II places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. . It also empowers the president to make recess appointments , without Senate approval : `` The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate , by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session . '' Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides : `` No <head> part </head> of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person .

For the Agency for International Development , appropriators approved $ 200 million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program , and total loan guarantees for the Overseas Private Investment Corp. are increased by $ 40 million over fiscal 1989 as <head> part </head> of the same Poland package . The conference approved at least $ 55 million in direct cash and development assistance as well , and though no decision was made , both sides are committed to adding more than $ 200 million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the Bush administration . The agreement on Poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill , which has already provoked veto threats by the White House and is sharply confined under this year 's budget .

Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past , and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well-connected developers and lobbyists , as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal , or congressmen .

And for six years , NBC , ABC and CBS have negotiated with Hollywood studios in a futile attempt to change that . But with foreign companies snapping up U.S. movie studios , the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever . They hope the foreign deals will divide the Hollywood opposition and prod Congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning <head> part </head> of the shows they put on the air . Even network executives , however , admit privately that victory -- either in Congress or in talks with the studios -- is highly doubtful any time soon . And so the networks also are pushing for new ways to sidestep the `` fin-syn '' provisions , known formally as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules .

The networks still are `` uninhibited in their authority '' over what shows get on the air , charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti , the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules . Studios are `` powerless '' to get shows in prime-time lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales , he contends . And that 's why the rules , for the most <head> part </head> , must stay in place , he says . Studio executives in on the talks - including officials at Paramount Communications Inc. , Fries Entertainment Inc. , Warner Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. -- declined to be interviewed . But Mr. Valenti , who represents the studios , asserts : `` The whole production industry , to a man , is on the side of preserving '' the rules .

The latest provocation : Sony Corp. 's plan to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $ 3.4 billion , and to buy independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million .

Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing .

And it was stupid . The theory was that the Voice is a propaganda agency and this government should n't propagandize its own people . That sounds neat , but this government -- any government -- propagandizes its own <head> people </head> every day . Government press releases , speeches , briefings , tours of military facilities , publications are all propaganda of sorts . Propaganda is just information to support a viewpoint , and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue .

We ( I assume you 're in this with me at this point ) need to get three words -- `` for examination only '' -- eliminated from the law . Section 501 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 says Voice material shall be available to certain of us ( but now , thanks to the USIA 's new position , all of us ) `` for examination only . '' If those words were n't there , the nice <head> people </head> at the Voice would be able to send you the information or , at the very least , let you photocopy it . This is not a trivial issue . `` You have ... raised important questions which ought to be answered : What does USIA say about America abroad ; how do we say it ; and how can American taxpayers get the answers to these questions ? '' a man wrote me a couple of years ago .

The Stanley affair does n't bode well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in Namibia when SWAPO starts running the government .

`` The next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables , '' says Jon Petrovich , executive vice president of Headline News , CNN 's sister network . But that wo n't be easy . Networks , like other consumer products , develop images in <head> peoples </head> ' minds that are n't easy to change . It also takes money that CNN has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see . And the cable-TV operators -- CNN 's distributors and part owners -- like things just the way they are .

`` Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity , '' says Paul Amos , CNN executive vice president for programming . Accordingly , CNN is adding a world-affairs show in the morning because surveys show its global-news hour in the afternoon is among its most `` differentiated '' programs in viewers ' minds , says Mr. Amos . And it is exploring other original programs , similar to its `` Larry King Live '' and `` Crossfire '' talk shows , which executives hope will keep <head> people </head> tuned in . Then there 's `` The World Today , '' the prime-time newscast featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. Crier . Until now , CNN has featured its Hollywood gossip show during the key evening period .

Mr. Amos says the Shaw-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day , with most of the program , at least for now , appearing similar to CNN 's other newcasts . Some in the industry are skeptical . `` I find it hard to conceive of <head> people </head> switching over to CNN for what , at least in the public 's mind , is the same news , '' says Reuven Frank , the former two-time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report . The evening news is also slated as CNN 's stage for its big push into investigative journalism . In August , the network hired award-winning producer Pamela Hill , the former head of news specials at ABC .

CNN recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15 % , but they 're still drastically underpaid compared with the networks . Says Mr. Mosettig : `` CNN is my wire service ; they 're on top of everything . But to improve , they 've really got to make the investment in <head> people </head> . '' In any case , cable-TV-system operators have reason to fear any tinkering with CNN 's format . They market cable-TV on the very grazing opportunities CNN seeks to discourage .

Ms. Cunningham , a novelist and playwright , has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall .

In the Babylonian Bronx , Jewish working-class <head> people </head> lived in drab , Soviet-style buildings `` glamorized '' with names like AnaMor Towers ( after owners Anna and Morris Snezak ) , whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks , friezes of Pompeii .

'' Sharp-witted and funny but never mean , she 's a memorialist a bit like Truman Capote , if he 'd been Jewish and female and less bitchy .

While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for P&amp;G will be in the $ 4 billion U.S. detergent market , where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders . The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name since it 's already expanded its best-selling Tide into 16 different varieties , including this year 's big hit , Tide with Bleach . With superconcentrates , however , it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more ; many <head> people </head> tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine , believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry . In the early 1980s , P&amp;G tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the Ariel brand name that it markets in Europe . But the product , which was n't as concentrated as the new Cheer , bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped .

Are such expenditures worthwhile , then ? Yes , if targeted . <head> People </head> of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve , but there are many ways for middle-class kids , and their elders , to serve at little public cost . They can volunteer at any of thousands of non-profit institutions , or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers . Underclass youth do n't have those opportunities .

Strictly speaking , these youth are not performing service . They are giving up no income , deferring no careers , incurring no risk .

If only we could get America 's wastrel youth into at least a psychic uniform we might be able to teach self-discipline again and revive the spirit of giving . A quarter of a century ago national service was promoted as a way of curing the manifest inequities of the draft -- by , of all things , expanding the draft . Those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young <head> people </head> is still the true long-term aim of many national-service backers , despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion . Choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to doom national service as much as the draft . But the virus was kept alive in sociology departments until a couple of years ago , when it again was let loose .

A huge ANC flag , with black , green and gold stripes , was hoisted over the rickety gate at Mr. Sisulu 's modest house , while on the street out front , boys displayed the ANC colors on their shirts , caps and scarves . At the small four-room home of Elias Motsoaledi , a leading ANC unionist and a former commander in the group 's armed wing , Umkhonto we Sizwe , well-wishers stuck little ANC flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in ANC ribbons . `` I am happy to see the spirit of the <head> people </head> , '' said Mr. Sisulu , looking dapper in a new gray suit .

Peter Marcus , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. , said that a downturn in the appliance industry , coupled with sluggish automotive sales , hurt USX results .

Almost all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy , and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences . If spreads available from index arbitrage are so enormous , surely any sizable mutual-fund company could profit from offering it to small investors . The sad reality is that the retail investor continues to pursue stellar performers first , while leaving institutions to grapple with basis <head> points </head> of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter . Cost-effective index funds just are n't sexy enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay , and that institutional customers refuse to pay . Each new trading roadblock is likely to be beaten by institutions seeking better ways to serve their high-volume clients , here or overseas .

THE STOCK MARKET AVOIDED a repeat of Black Monday as prices recovered from an early slide , spurred by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders . The Dow Jones industrials closed up 88.12 points , at 2657.38 , the fourth-biggest gain ever , after being down as much as 63.52 <head> points </head> in the morning .

In fact , some economists contend that the latest easing started last week . Others note that some investors were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing . The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond , ended about 1 3\/4 <head> points </head> lower , or down about $ 17.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount . The reversal was even more evident among shorter-term Treasury securities .

After Treasury bill rates plummeted as much as 0.70 percentage <head> point </head> on Friday , they gave back three-fourths of that amount yesterday .

Investment-grade corporate bonds , mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds also fell .

Investment-grade corporate bonds , mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds also fell . But prices of junk bonds , which were battered Friday in near standstill trading , rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session . Junk bonds opened as much as four <head> points </head> lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed . Some traders said the high-yield market was helped by active institutional buying . In particular , they said , firms such as First Boston Corp. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels .

`` I think the willingness of securities companies to make markets for high-yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds , '' said John Lonski , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc . U.S. Treasury bonds were higher in overnight trading in Japan , which opened at about 7:30 p.m. EDT . The benchmark 30-year bond , for example rose one <head> point </head> in early Japanese trading in reaction to a quick 600-point drop in the Tokyo stock market . But as Japanese stocks rebounded , Treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher . Many U.S. trading operations , wanting to keep a watchful eye on Japanese trading as an indication of where U.S. trading would begin , were fully staffed during the Tokyo trading session .

Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions .

But the date tends to be a plus , not a minus , for stocks , according to Yale Hirsch , a collector of stock market lore . Another study found that the 82 Fridays the 13th in the 1940-1987 period had higher than average returns -- higher even than Fridays in general , which tend to be strong days for stock prices .

But the airlines are scarcely a clear case , given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner , who professes to believe safety will be compromised if KLM and British Airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes . Worse , Congress has started to jump on the Skinner bandwagon .

James Oberstar , the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee 's aviation subcommittee , has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the American and United Air Lines bids . It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion or more . So the UAL deal has problems , and the market loses 190 <head> points </head> . Congratulations , Mr. Secretary and Mr. Congressman .

Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` hot-line '' communications among exchanges . Those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels . During the first halt , after the S&amp;P index had fallen 12 <head> points </head> , the Big Board 's `` Sidecar '' computer program automatically was triggered . That system is designed to separate computer-generated program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks .

The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government .

Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations .

The question is whether his only means of defense is the veto . Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto .

The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability . One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers .

The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate . If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will <head> policy </head> makers , and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions . Yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral , but they rode the tiger up all year . Not surprisingly , he sometimes bites .

Although the average citizen is probably not harmed too much from Washington 's rhetorical war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial leveraging , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm . Any such attempt to distinguish `` good debt '' from `` bad debt , '' or to draw the line at a particular industry , such as the airlines , is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general . Far better for <head> policy </head> makers to concentrate on the war against drugs , Panama and the deficit , all of them parades that seem never to end . Mr. Jarrell , former top economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission , teaches at the University of Rochester 's Simon Business School .

As Mr. Colton of the NAHB acknowledges : `` Government is not going to solve the problem ... . The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down .

But if the stock market does n't continue to plummet , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate . The Fed , which until Friday had been resisting moves to ease credit , is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets . Fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate <head> policies </head> . But the experience of the 1987 crash suggests the Fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets . Anticipating the Fed 's move , money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the Federal Funds rate to 8.625 % late Friday , down from 8.820 % the day before .

A few hours later , the stock market dropped 190 points . Politicians tried to finger each other for the blame , although many analysts doubt that Washington was singly responsible for Wall Street 's woes . But Mr. Butcher 's comments make one thing clear : Some on Wall Street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic <head> policy </head> . Consider this : -- By 11:59 p.m. tonight , President Bush must order $ 16 billion of automatic , across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the Gramm-Rudman budget law .

The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill . `` We simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices , '' House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta ( D. , Calif . ) said yesterday on NBC News 's `` Meet the Press . '' -- For the last two weeks , the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic <head> policy </head> . The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower ; the Fed has been resisting . `` One of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board , '' said Lawrence Kudlow , a Bear , Stearns &amp; Co. economist , on ABC 's `` This Week .

Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold . The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic <head> policy </head> , although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve . And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department -- were making markets nervous . The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit , resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ 76 billion -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion during that period .

'' In that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around . `` There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen ( D. , Texas ) .

When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , hailed it .

Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit , the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ 145.21 billion . That rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy . `` I think the Friday report , combined with the actions of the Fed , weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary <head> policy </head> , '' said Robert Dederick , chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago . But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers . `` The overall 0.9 % increase is serious in itself , but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy , the producer price index still increased by 0.7 % , '' said Gordon Richards , an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers .

Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought .

Farmers are in the best <head> position </head> of many years to push up corn prices . Because the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles , they have more than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise .

Article II places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. .

Thus , with one brief passage in an appropriations bill , Congress repeals the president 's power to make recess appointments under Article II .

The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any <head> position </head> of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary . The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government .

From the outset , the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow .

Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of behind-the-scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane , but politically important , projects of members . In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida , Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor .

On one side of this <head> power </head> struggle stand the forces in ascendency on Wall Street -- the New Guard -- consisting of high-tech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms , their pension fund clients with immense pools of money , and the traders at the fast-growing Chicago futures exchanges . These are the main proponents of program trading . Defending their ramparts are Wall Street 's Old Guard -- the traditional , stock-picking money managers , tens of thousands of stock brokers , the New York Stock Exchange 's listed companies and the clannish floor traders , known as specialists , who make markets in their stocks .

To the extent they did , their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability . Moreover , the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation . It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause ( technically a limitation on legislative <head> power </head> ) could be read as placing the president on Congress 's short leash , making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress . As it went to the conference panel now deliberating , the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money . During the coming weeks , President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II , and thus void and severable .

Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny . There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other . Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive <head> power </head> than Section 609 of the executive-office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States . '' This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law , since a one-house resolution could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto . The Supreme Court 's decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional .

Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto . As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives . The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a <head> power </head> of far more limited applicability . One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers . There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills .

Many of the toy makers ' problems started well before June 4 as a result of overstrained infrastructure and Beijing 's austerity programs launched late last year . Toy makers complain that electricity in Guangdong has been provided only three days a week in recent months , down from five days a week , as the province 's rapid industrialization has outstripped its generating capacity . Manufacturers are upgrading standby <head> power </head> plants . Bank credit for China investments all but dried up following June 4 . Also , concern exists that the harder-line Beijing leadership will tighten its control of Guangdong , which has been the main laboratory for the open-door policy and economic reforms .

Naturally , neither General Dynamics nor Dassault could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid ( or not ) to various Greek officials for services rendered . So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter : PASOK , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou 's expense . But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help PASOK regain <head> power </head> , Mr. Papandreou should never be underestimated . First came his predictable fusillade : He charged the Coalition of the Left and Progress had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right-wing plot aimed at ousting PASOK and thwarting the course of socialism in Greece . Then , to buttress his credibility with the left , he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the PASOK banner .

U.S. OFFICIALS MOVED to head off any repeat of Black Monday today following Friday 's plunge in stock prices . Fed Chairman Greenspan signaled that the central bank was <head> prepared </head> to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system to prevent a financial crisis . Other U.S. and foreign officials also mapped out plans , though they kept their moves quiet to avoid making the financial markets more jittery .

Government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a Monday market meltdown -- but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet . Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones , making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was <head> prepared </head> to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in October 1987 , if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis . And at the Treasury , Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David Mullins carefully analyzed data on the Friday market plunge . But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters .

In addition , officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout . `` The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' said one government official , insisting on anonymity . The Fed 's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled Sunday morning , when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories quoting a senior Fed official saying the central bank was <head> prepared </head> to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning . Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised by both stories , according to knowledgeable sources , and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment . Nevertheless , Fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central bank 's game plan .

All in all , though , there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking ; ; many people go to extreme lengths in decanting , chilling or warming , or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork . No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this , and to give fair warning where warning is due , no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism ! ! But the fact remains that in most restaurants , including some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon , the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered , and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is <head> preparing </head> the meal . A white wine , already at cool cellar temperature , may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator ( the former is far preferable ) in about fifteen minutes ; ; for those who live in a winter climate , there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow . Though by no means an ideal procedure , a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time .

People close to the utility industry said Mr. Dingell 's proposal appears to guarantee only an estimated seven-million-ton cut in annual sulfur-dioxide emissions that lead to acid rain , though additional cuts could be ordered later . Mr. Bush 's legislative package promises to cut emissions by 10 million tons -- basically in half -- by the year 2000 . Although final details were n't available , sources said the Dingell plan would abandon the <head> president </head> 's proposal for a cap on utilities ' sulfur-dioxide emissions . That proposal had been hailed by environmentalists but despised by utilities because they feared it would limit their growth .

Congress learned during the Reagan administration that it could intimidate the executive branch by uttering again and again the same seven words : `` Provided , that no funds shall be spent ... .

It signals Congress 's attempt , under the pretext of guarding the public purse , to deny the <head> president </head> the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in Article II of the Constitution . This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional .

This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional .

'' The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the <head> president </head> through the ability to withhold funding . This interpretation was officially endorsed by Congress in 1987 in the Iran-Contra Report . As partisans of congressional power understand , a `` power of the purse '' so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers .

Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States . '' This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law , since a one-house resolution could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the <head> president </head> for his signature or veto . The Supreme Court 's decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional . President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives .

Interprovincial , Canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S. , said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991 , 8 % lower than a previous estimate . Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level . `` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said Ronald Watkins , vice <head> president </head> for government and industry relations with Interprovincial 's parent , Interhome Energy Inc . Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial 's system is down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s . `` There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , '' he said .

Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude . Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial 's system , whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region , including Chicago , Buffalo , Toronto and Montreal . Canada 's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net U.S. crude imports , said John Lichtblau , <head> president </head> of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation . That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude , behind Saudi Arabia , Nigeria and Mexico . Mr. Lichtblau said Canada 's declining crude output , combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude , will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas , particularly the Middle East .

Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability . The gasoline picture may improve this quarter , but chemicals are likely to remain weak , industry executives and analysts say , reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance . The industry is `` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals , '' Glenn Cox , <head> president </head> of Phillips Petroleum Co. , said in an interview . `` That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings '' for the industry in general , he added .

There 's no need for such concessions . The omnibus can be defeated , the virus controlled , and real service protected .

The market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the Treasury was right about the overpriced dollar . A modest drop in the dollar -- only a modest one , mind you -- would be welcomed by the U.S. . That was n't the case in 1987 , when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse , <head> producing </head> panic among foreign investors and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the U.S. . Another big difference between 1987 and 1989 is n't so comforting . In the third quarter of 1987 , the economy spurted at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.3 % .

The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , '' said Robert Feick , manager of crude oil with Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an industry group . Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada . Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude <head> produced </head> in western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude . Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial 's system , whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region , including Chicago , Buffalo , Toronto and Montreal . Canada 's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net U.S. crude imports , said John Lichtblau , president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation .

As the 1992 economic integration approaches , Europe 's cultural curators have taken to the ramparts against American `` cultural imperialism , '' threatening to impose quotas against such pop invaders as `` Dallas , '' `` Miami Vice '' and `` L.A.

A world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to <head> produce </head> sexual relationships in which wives are more self-assertive , too '' . Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous . It can , in fact , wreck a marriage .

What does it mean to be creative , a term we hear with increasing frequency these days ? ? When we turn to Noah Webster we find him helpful as usual . `` To be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist -- to <head> produce </head> where nothing was before -- to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power '' . We are creative , it seems , when we produce something which has not previously existed . Thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake , building a chicken coop , or producing a book , to founding a business , creating a League of Nations or , developing a mature character .

Man 's great superiority over these evolutionary forbears is in the development of his imagination .

It has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can <head> produce </head> or create by projecting this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world . In our own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a Jules Verne come into actuality .

I recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which I lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town .

And when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious mind is able to <head> produce </head> it '' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind . Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence . The question becomes , `` What is a dream '' ? ?

Muzzling provisions , which might be called `` blindfold laws '' as well , prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options , let alone from recommending them to Congress . Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations . Typically , these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or <head> proposing </head> more market-oriented alternatives to regulations . Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny . There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other .

If anti-Semitism was on trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department of Jewish Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as well as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ? ? The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich in January 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe , was attended by representatives of major organs of the German state , including the Reich Minister of the Interior , the State Secretary in charge of the Four Year Plan , the Reich Minister of Justice , the Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs . The measures for annihilation <head> proposed </head> and accepted at the Conference affected industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government . Heydrich , in opening the Conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as `` a complement to '' previous `` solutions '' for eliminating the Jews from German living space through violence , economic strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation . In other words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder .

Since then , many Protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements , in which they not only approved birth control , but declared it at times to be a religious duty . What determines the morality , they state , is not the means used , but the motive In general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that <head> prove </head> most effective are considered the most ethical . This development is reflected in the action taken in February , 1961 , by the general board of the National Council of Churches , the largest Protestant organization in the A[fj] . The board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family planning .

`` It is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial '' -- said Ben Gurion , `` and not the Nazi regime alone -- but anti-Semitism throughout history '' . How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews without being an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-Semitism ? ? And if it was not an individual who was in the dock , why was the Trial , as we shall observe later , all but scuttled in the attempt to <head> prove </head> Eichmann a `` fiend '' ? ? These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case . It might be contended , of course , that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism .

Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . At any rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to <head> prove </head> actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to that extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it . If anti-Semitism was on trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department of Jewish Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as well as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ? ?

Not in Eichmann 's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial . No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of Jews , as do others like them today . The Final Solution <head> proved </head> that the Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others . Ought not an edifying Trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how representative types of `` mere '' anti-Semites were drawn step by step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings ? ? The Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-Semitism '' among the Germans which Hitler `` stimulated and transformed '' .

But though this characterization in no way diminished Eichmann 's guilt , the Prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of it . Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters -- i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia -- and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity -- Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ? ? Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism <head> proved </head> less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports ? ? Was n't this meaning of Eichmann 's experience in various countries worth highlighting ? ? As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage , the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) .

Fin-syn rules do n't explicitly block a network from buying a passive , small stake in a company that profits from the rerun syndication networks ca n't enjoy . Hence , NBC might be able to take , say , a 5 % stake in a company such as MGM\/UA . If the transaction <head> raised </head> objections , the studio 's syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake . But such convolutions would still block the networks from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication .

The addition , on top of two big 1987 additions to foreign-loan reserves , brings the reserve to a level equaling 79 % of medium-term and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations . First Chicago since 1987 has reduced its loans to such nations to $ 1.7 billion from $ 3 billion . Despite this loss , First Chicago said it does n't need to sell stock to <head> raise </head> capital . During the quarter , the company realized a pretax gain of $ 60.4 million from the sale of its First Chicago Investment Advisors unit . Combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped 24 % against last year 's third quarter , to $ 38.2 million from $ 50.5 million .

This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn : the success of Senate Democrats in stalling the capital gains tax cut . The real value of all shares , after all , is directly impacted by the tax on any profits ( all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not `` ordinary income '' ) . And market expectations clearly have been <head> raised </head> by the capital gains victory in the House last month . An hour before Friday 's plunge , that provision was stripped from the tax bill , leaving it with $ 5.4 billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut . There is a great deal to be said , to be sure , for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill .

And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists , or market makers . When the Brady Task Force 's powerful analysis of the crash was released in January 1988 , it immediately reshaped the reformers ' agenda . Arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one , and concluding that the crash had `` <head> raised </head> the possibility of a full-scale financial system breakdown , '' the presidential task force called for establishing a super-regulator to oversee the markets , to make margins consistent across markets , to unify clearing systems and to install circuit breakers . Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented . The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies .

As other repressive governments , particularly Poland and the Soviet Union , have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control . As the days go by , the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency . If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC , the expectations and promise <head> raised </head> by yesterday 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest . If it does , the large number of right-wing whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands .

During a 1933 tsunami in Japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night . The luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism Noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence of the sea .

GMAC screened the card-member list for holders more than 30 years old with household incomes over $ 45,000 who had n't `` missed any payments , '' the Buick spokeswoman says . Some 3.8 million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with GMAC . These 3.8 million people also are eligible to get one percentage point off GMAC 's advertised finance <head> rates </head> , which start at 6.9 % for two-year loan contracts . A spokesman for Visa International 's U.S. subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards , but does n't have plans for a tie-in similar to the American Express-Buick link . Three divisions at American Express are working with Buick on the promotion : the establishment services division , which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card ; the travel division ; and the merchandise sales division .

The sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments , running from an import exemption for a California airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of Panama 's quota of exports to the profitable U.S. market . Panama was stripped of this right because of U.S. differences with the Noriega regime , but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21-month period ending Sept. 30 , 1990 . About a quarter of this share has already been reallocated , according to the industry , but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current U.S. price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world <head> rate </head> . The potential sales are nearly $ 9.3 million , and House Majority Whip William Gray ( D. , Pa . ) began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to English-speaking countries of the Caribbean , such as Jamaica and Barbados . Rep. Jerry Lewis , a conservative Californian , added a provision of his own intended to assist Bolivia , and the Senate then broadened the list further by including all countries in the U.S. Caribbean Basin initiate as well as the Philippines - backed by the powerful Hawaii Democrat Sen. Daniel Inouye .

`` I look at it as a ho-hum matter , '' he says . Many other factors played a part in yesterday 's comeback . The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity ; the interest <head> rate </head> on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day . Foreign stock markets , which kicked off Black Monday with a huge selling spree , began the day off by relatively modest amounts . The dollar , after falling sharply in overnight trading to 139.10 yen , bounced back strongly to 141.8 , thus easing fears that foreigners would unload U.S. stocks .

Finally , according to Mr. Cardillo , the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit , when the figures are released today .

He also feels that the rise of such computer-based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's relevancy to the economic outlook .

Contributing to the selling pressure were dispatches by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios . Among the firms were Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc . The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds <head> rate </head> to drift as low as 8 1\/2 % . The closely watched rate on federal funds , or overnight loans between banks , slid to about 8 3\/4 % last week , down from its perceived target level of about 9 % . The rate is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy .

The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond , ended about 1 3\/4 points lower , or down about $ 17.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount . The reversal was even more evident among shorter-term Treasury securities . After Treasury bill <head> rates </head> plummeted as much as 0.70 percentage point on Friday , they gave back three-fourths of that amount yesterday . The bond-equivalent yield on three-month Treasury bills , for example , was quoted late yesterday at 7.72 % , compared with 7.16 % Friday . Investment-grade corporate bonds , mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds also fell .

The continuing series of HUD scandals is a sadly predictable result of pork-barrel politics . Nevertheless , lobbies such as the National Association of Home Builders ( NAHB ) continue to pressure Capitol Hill for more special-interest spending . Kent Colton , NAHB executive vice president , argues that the U.S. faces a multifaceted housing crisis -- reduced affordability of homes for first-time buyers , increased homelessness , and lower apartment construction <head> rates </head> -- that will be `` very difficult '' to solve `` without expanded federal resources . '' There 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending . But the NAHB was created in 1943 out of an organization that made its name fighting a Roosevelt administration proposal to take over all defense housing production .

Two years ago when the NAHB lobbied for the $ 19 billion omnibus housing bill , the organization `` basically dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition , '' says Ms. MacDonald . As Mr. Colton of the NAHB acknowledges : `` Government is not going to solve the problem ... . The real key is to have the economy working and interest <head> rates </head> down . '' More money for HUD will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy ; more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies . Is this what the home builders want ?

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Morgan climbed $ 1.50 a share to $ 44.125 . Net interest income sank 27 % in the quarter to $ 254 million from $ 347 million . The interest <head> rate </head> on short-term funds , which banks borrow to finance longer-term loans to customers , was `` sharply higher , '' Morgan said . Morgan received $ 2 million of interest payments on its medium and long-term Brazilian loans ; had they been accruing interest , net interest income would have been $ 35 million higher in the quarter , Morgan said . Such loans to Argentina also remain classified as non-accruing , costing the bank $ 10 million of interest income in the third period .

The complex financing plan in the S&amp;L bailout law includes raising $ 30 billion from debt issued by the newly created RTC . This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit . Another $ 20 billion would be raised through Treasury bonds , which pay lower interest <head> rates </head> . But the RTC also requires `` working '' capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately . That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion , or $ 166 billion including interest over 10 years .

That was n't the case in 1987 , when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse , producing panic among foreign investors and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the U.S. .

The consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish 2.3 % in the third quarter of 1989 , which ended two weeks ago .

Overall , the index has climbed at a 5.1 % compound annual <head> rate </head> since the start of the year , the Labor Department said . While far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year , that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0 % increase for all of 1988 . Moreover , this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month , when energy prices zoomed up 6.5 % after plunging 7.3 % in August .

What real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as Houston 's or Denver 's ?

Vacancy <head> rates </head> in the 15 % to 19 % range today may easily rise to the low to mid-20 % range in a couple of years . Under these conditions , even a flattening out of economic growth -- `` catching cold '' -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia . Those looking for real-estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short-term ( three-year ) lease and wait for the bargains ahead .

The newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to `` become very unreasonable '' and reduce needed funds for investment in the `` already difficult state budget .

On Thursday , William Fleckenstein , a Seattle money manager , used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline . He thinks the underlying inflation <head> rate </head> is around 5 % to 6 % , far higher than most people suppose . In the pension accounts he manages , Mr. Fleckenstein has raised cash positions and invested in gold and natural gas stocks , partly as an inflation hedge . He thinks government officials are terrified to let a recession start when government , corporate and personal debt levels are so high .

The inflation-adjusted growth <head> rate </head> for France 's gross domestic product for the second quarter was revised upward to 0.8 % from the previous three months from the initial estimate of 0.7 % , the National Statistics Institute said . The state agency said the latest revision left the growth rate for the first-quarter compared with the previous three months unchanged at 1.3 % . If the economy continues to expand by 0.8 % a quarter for the rest of the year , it would leave GDP growth for all of 1989 at 3 % , the institute said .

McCain says Mr. Keating broke off their friendship abruptly in 1987 , because the senator refused to press the thrift executive 's case as vigorously as Mr. Keating wanted . `` He became very angry at that , left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp , '' Sen. McCain <head> recalls </head> . In July , California newspapers disclosed that Mr. Keating gave $ 850,000 in corporate funds to three tax-exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of Sen.

The study of Greek was the distinctive mark of boys destined to go to college , and Lucy Upton too expected to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men .

The famous author tells us of the strange incident in Something About Myself . One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` I want a word with you , please '' . At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly <head> recalling </head> that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier . Freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation Of Dreams , Chapter 1 : : As `` a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case , , and what is more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' .

I <head> recall </head> the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which I lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town . I am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence , so complete in detail , from the hodge-podge of news pictures I have seen . And when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious mind is able to produce it '' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind .

Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . Absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify . Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably <head> receiving </head> extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime .

He has ample motive to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found less than forthright on numerous points . Nevertheless , the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity . Among unanswered questions are whether Mr. Papandreou <head> received </head> $ 23 million of stolen Bank of Crete funds and an additional $ 734,000 in bribes , as contended ; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ 57 million in Mr. Koskotas 's bank and then skim off the interest ; and , what PASOK 's cut was from the $ 210 million Mr. Koskotas pinched . Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the Koskotas affair that PASOK members of Parliament voted to refer them to the special court . But eluding parliamentary probe was the case of millions of drachmas Mr. Koskotas funneled into New Democracy coffers .

Despite convincing arguments , it was never established that Mr. Papandreou personally ordered or directed the wiretaps . The central weakness of the `` scandals '' debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks . The coalition government tried to show that PASOK ministers had <head> received </head> hefty sums for OKing the purchase of F-16 Fighting Falcon and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft , produced by the U.S.based General Dynamics Corp. and France 's Avions Marcel Dassault , respectively . Naturally , neither General Dynamics nor Dassault could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid ( or not ) to various Greek officials for services rendered . So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter : PASOK , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou 's expense .

Goldman officials declined to comment . Junk bonds , which mushroomed from less than $ 2 billion at the start of this decade , have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments . The shaky market <head> received </head> its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp. , which created its U.S. retailing empire with junk financing .

Now , dozens of corporations , including Ethan Allen , TW Services and York International , that are counting on at least $ 7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat , may never get the money .

All in all , though , there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking ; ; many people go to extreme lengths in decanting , chilling or warming , or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork . No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this , and to give fair warning where warning is due , no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism ! !

A white wine , already at cool cellar temperature , may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator ( the former is far preferable ) in about fifteen minutes ; ; for those who live in a winter climate , there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow . Though by no means an ideal procedure , a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time .

As was noted earlier , it is important that in valid , objective study of this sort of communication , the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive . Dr. Karlis Osis , Director of Research at the Parapsychology Foundation , described the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article , ( `` New Research On Survival After Death '' , Spring 1958 ) . He remarked : `` It has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was <head> received </head> telepathically by the medium from the sitter '' . The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium 's ESP may tap the memory of the sitter , and to do this , the two central characters in this drama must be separated . One way to do this is by `` proxy sittings '' , wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute , the proxy sitter .

Most of the teen-agers I interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds . `` When you marry , you want to have things in common '' , a girl said , `` and it 's hard when you do n't marry someone with your own background '' . A fourteen-year-old girl from the Middle West observed wryly that , in her community , religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities -- at least with the peripheral activities that many middle class Jews now <head> regard </head> as religious . It appears that an Orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because she would not travel on Saturday and , in addition , required kosher food . Another girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as `` the only Orthodox girl in town '' .

However , among the girls , there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going to college .

The grounds for the Church 's position are Scriptural ( Old Testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural law . The latter plays a prominent role in Roman Catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from Scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods . The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition <head> regards </head> as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end . This conclusion is based on two propositions : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God 's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangements . Thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation , the propagation of the race .

The various Lambeth Conferences , expressing the Anglican viewpoint , mirror the gradual change that has taken place among Protestants generally . In 1920 , the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together with the grave dangers -- physical , moral , and religious -- thereby incurred , and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race '' . Denouncing the view that the sexual union is an end in itself , the Conference declared : `` We steadfastly uphold what must always be <head> regarded </head> as the governing considerations of Christian marriage . One is the primary purpose for which marriage exists , namely , the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children ; ; the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control '' . The Conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives .

It can , in fact , wreck a marriage . When a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife 's desires , she is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her . And she begins to <head> regard </head> him as savage , bestial and unworthy . On the other hand , wifely supremacy demeans the husband , saps his self-respect , and robs him of his masculinity .

In answering these questions , we need to ask not merely whether Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before , and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded : the success of Communism 's war against the West does not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests . Success may mean merely the displacement of Western influence . Communist political warfare , we must <head> remember </head> , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages . Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win , the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant -- in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators , at the United Nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences -- preferably at the highest level . The Soviets understand , moreover , that the first step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against the West .

Contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago , when all malocclusion was blamed on some unfortunate habit , recent studies show that most tooth irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition . However , this does not mean that a child 's teeth or jaws must necessarily resemble those of someone in his family . Tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb - or finger-sucking , tongue-thrusting , or lip-sucking -- but it 's important to <head> remember </head> that there 's a difference between normal and excessive sucking habits . It 's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs , and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old . Occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect a youngster 's teeth ; ; but after that , if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent , it will have an effect .

Every dream , and this is true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought , is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available .

You will come up with a frightening total .

The Postmaster General recently <head> reported </head> that mail order frauds -- among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently -- are at the highest level in history . Similarly , the American Cancer Society ( ACS ) , the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation , and the BBB have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high .

This calamity is `` far from over , '' he says . Junk 's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one-day dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19 , 1987 , crash . Simultaneously , it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the U.S. government bond market as investors <head> rushed </head> to move capital into the highest-quality securities they could find . But `` an eerie silence pervaded '' the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite `` no active trading , '' says John Lonski , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc . For example , the price of Southland Corp. 's $ 500 million of 16 3\/4 % bonds due 2002 -- sold less than two years ago by Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co. -- plummeted 25 % to just 30 cents on the dollar .

-- By 11:59 p.m. tonight , President Bush must order $ 16 billion of automatic , across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the Gramm-Rudman budget law . The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill . `` We simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices , '' House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta ( D. , Calif . ) <head> said </head> yesterday on NBC News 's `` Meet the Press . '' -- For the last two weeks , the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy .

But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision . And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines , which includes a big stake by British Airways PLC . Some analysts <head> say </head> uncertainty about Washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop . In many ways , the backdrop to Friday 's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987 's 508-point crash . Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold .

Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's gimmick-ridden plan , which still is n't fully implemented . One of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that , as everyone learned in 1987 , the economy and the market can survive a one-day 508-point tumble . `` Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929 , that we were looking at a recession , '' Rep. Panetta <head> said </head> yesterday in an interview . `` That did not happen . They learned they could survive it without much problem . ''

'' In that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around . `` There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen ( D. , Texas ) .

Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than Friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital-gains fight . Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation .

Friday 's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the House and Senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest . Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit . `` The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , Sen. Warren Rudman ( R. , N.H . ) . <head> said </head> yesterday . The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion . Rep. Panetta said that OMB 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . ''

Another study found that the 82 Fridays the 13th in the 1940-1987 period had higher than average returns -- higher even than Fridays in general , which tend to be strong days for stock prices . On the only other Friday the 13th this year , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about four points . Professor Kolb <head> says </head> the original study , titled Friday the 13th , Part VII , was published tongue-in-cheek . In a similar vein , he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and Saturday 's full moon could have played a part , too , in Friday 's market activity .

If it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks , he <head> says </head> , `` That could quiet things down . '' If not , `` We could go to 2200 very soon . '' Frank W. Terrizzi .

Late Friday night , the Senate voted 87-7 to approve an estimated $ 13.5 billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened , rather than narrowed , the federal budget deficit . Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases . `` We 're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction bill , '' <head> said </head> Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser ( D. , Tenn . ) . But Senate supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through Congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside , including a capital-gains tax cut .

It probably would , because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language . In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism . For example , the New York state counsel for the NAACP <head> said </head> that Mr. Mason is `` like a dinosaur . People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck . '' These critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group , such as `` Polish jokes '' ; and the type that is double-edged , aiming inward as well as outward .

As Elizabeth Kristol wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason donnybrook , `` Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer . '' The question is , if group conflicts still exist ( as undeniably they do ) , and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ? Do n't <head> say </head> the TV sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy . It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in `` Cheers '' ; children vs. adults in `` The Cosby Show .

The population of all four states is on the upswing , according to new Census Bureau estimates , following declines throughout the early 1980s . The gains , to be sure , are rather small . Iowa , for instance , saw its population grow by 11,000 people , or 0.4 % , between 1987 and 1988 , the Census Bureau <head> says </head> . Still , even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n't grown at all since 1981 . Between 1987 and 1988 , North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest to lose population , a loss of 4,000 people .

`` There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , '' he said . Many of Canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly . The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , '' <head> said </head> Robert Feick , manager of crude oil with Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an industry group . Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada . Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude .

Under terms of its proposed two-step expansion , which would have required regulatory approval , Interprovincial intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system , beginning with a modest expansion by 1991 .

Companies with which GEC has had talks about a possible joint Ferranti bid include Matra , Britain 's Dowty Group PLC , West Germany 's Daimler-Benz AG , and France 's Dassault group . But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid , the source indicated . GEC plans first to study Ferranti 's financial accounts , which auditors recently <head> said </head> included # 215 million in fictitious contracts at a U.S. unit , International Signal &amp; Control Group , with which Ferranti merged last year . Also , any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators ; Ferranti is GEC 's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts , and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country 's defense industry . A consortium bid , however , would diminish GEC 's direct role in Ferranti and might consequently appease ministry officials .

September 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists , and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge Friday . After falling for three consecutive months , the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9 % last month , the Labor Department reported Friday , as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer . Although the report , which was released before the stock market opened , did n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , analysts <head> said </head> it did play a role in the market 's decline . Analysts immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in months , as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped . Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit , the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ 145.21 billion .

Inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace last winter , when a steep run-up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double-digit annual rates . Energy prices then plummeted through the summer , causing the index to decline for three consecutive months . Overall , the index has climbed at a 5.1 % compound annual rate since the start of the year , the Labor Department <head> said </head> . While far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year , that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0 % increase for all of 1988 . Moreover , this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month , when energy prices zoomed up 6.5 % after plunging 7.3 % in August .

Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association said Imperial Corp. of America withdrew from regulators its application to buy five Valley Federal branches , leaving the transaction in limbo . The broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at Imperial Corp. , whose spokesman <head> said </head> the company withdrew its application from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision because of an informal notice that Imperial 's thrift unit failed to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements . The Community Reinvestment Act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received . The transaction , announced in August , included about $ 146 million in deposits at the five outlets in California 's San Joaquin Valley .

When the news broke of an attempted coup in Panama two weeks ago , Sen. Christopher Dodd called the State Department for a briefing . `` They <head> said </head> , ` follow CNN , ' '' he told reporters . That shows how far Ted Turner 's Cable News Network has come since its birth nine years ago , when it was considered the laughingstock of television news . It is bigger , faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks .

Although viewership soars when big news breaks , it ebbs during periods of calm .

'' So CNN , a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc. , is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel , or what people in the television industry call a `` top of mind '' network .

CNN executives hope the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its `` branded '' programs , in the way `` 60 Minutes '' did so well for CBS .

Gulf Resources &amp; Chemical Corp. <head> said </head> it agreed to pay $ 1.5 million as part of an accord with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a defunct smelter the company formerly operated in Idaho .

The problem , however , is that GM 's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs . Against that backdrop , UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich , who recently became head of the union 's GM department , issued a statement Friday blasting GM 's `` flagrant insensitivity '' toward union members . The auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed `` disarray '' and an `` inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information , '' Mr. Yokich <head> said </head> . GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves : Production of full-sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in Flint , Mich . That means two plants -- one in Scarborough , Ontario , and the other in Lordstown , Ohio -- probably will be shut down after the end of 1991 .

And they 're likely to stay that way for months to come , analysts say . For one thing , even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last , tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into 1990 , the analysts <head> say </head> . And if rain does n't fall soon across many of the Great Plains ' wheat-growing areas , yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced , further squeezing supplies . Also supporting prices are expectations that the Soviet Union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months .

That would be the lowest level since the early 1970s . Stocks were 698 million bushels on May 31 of this year . In response to dwindling domestic supplies , Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter last month <head> said </head> the U.S. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments . The government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million bushels . It now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion bushels , compared with this year 's estimated 2.04 billion and a drought-stunted 1.81 billion in 1988 .

But the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n't be felt until the second half of next year . Until then , limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $ 4-a-bushel level , analysts <head> say </head> . On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday , wheat for December delivery settled at $ 4.0675 a bushel , unchanged . In theory at least , tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply-demand squeeze , said Daniel Basse , a futures analyst with AgResource Co. in Chicago .

Most of the Western European members of Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls , the unofficial forum through which the U.S. and its allies align their export-control policies , are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in Paris Oct. 25 and 26 . They plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools , computers and other high-technology products . But the Bush administration <head> says </head> it wants to see evidence that all Cocom members are complying fully with existing export-control procedures before it will support further liberalization . To make its point , it is challenging the Italian government to explain reports that Olivetti may have supplied the Soviet Union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft . The London Sunday Times , which first reported the U.S. concerns , cited a U.S. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that Olivetti exported $ 25 million in `` embargoed , state-of-the-art , flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry . ''

Olivetti has denied that it violated Cocom rules , asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the Italian authorities . Although the legality of these sales is still an open question , the disclosure could n't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community . `` It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting , '' <head> said </head> a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies . The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export-control policies , reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies . Last summer , Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods .

But more recently , the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc . However , these agencies generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization . `` There 's no evidence that the Soviet program to ( illegally ) acquire Western technology has diminished , '' <head> said </head> a State Department spokesman .

Mrs. Hills ' first trip to Japan as America 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher .

But P&amp;G contends the new Cheer is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from fading . And retailers are expected to embrace the product , in part because it will take up less shelf space . `` When shelf space was cheap , bigger was better , '' <head> says </head> Hugh Zurkuhlen , an analyst at Salomon Bros . But with so many brands vying for space , that 's no longer the case . If the new Cheer sells well , the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates .

The networks still are `` uninhibited in their authority '' over what shows get on the air , charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti , the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules .

Under that standard , which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices , a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a `` reasonable '' justification for adopting it .

On the provisions of the Minnesota law , the Bush administration <head> said </head> that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows minors to go to court for a judge 's permission instead .

The cost to taxpayers of Lincoln 's collapse has been estimated at as much as $ 2.5 billion . Details of the affair have become public gradually over the past two years , mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers . In the midst of his 1988 re-election campaign , Sen. Riegle , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , returned $ 76,000 in contributions after a Detroit newspaper <head> said </head> that Mr. Keating had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators .

Sen. McCain said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter `` fell between the cracks . '' Mr. Keating , his family members and associates also donated $ 112,000 to Sen. McCain 's congressional campaigns over the years , according to press accounts . But Sen. McCain <head> says </head> Mr. Keating broke off their friendship abruptly in 1987 , because the senator refused to press the thrift executive 's case as vigorously as Mr. Keating wanted . `` He became very angry at that , left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp , '' Sen. McCain recalls . In July , California newspapers disclosed that Mr. Keating gave $ 850,000 in corporate funds to three tax-exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of Sen. Cranston , who conceded that soliciting the money was `` a pretty stupid thing to do politically . ''

Indeed , a Moody 's index that tracks the net asset values of 24 high-yield mutual funds declined for the 17th consecutive day Friday .

Well before Campeau , though , there were signs that the junk market was stumbling through one of its worst years ever .

-- In September , just as the cash squeeze hit Campeau , Lomas Financial Corp. defaulted on $ 145 million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $ 1.2 billion of debt securities .

But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants <head> said </head> the circuit breakers worked as intended . Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` hot-line '' communications among exchanges . Those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels .

That system is designed to separate computer-generated program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks .

Under the laws of the land , the ANC remains an illegal organization , and its headquarters are still in Lusaka , Zambia .

Deafening chants of `` ANC '' and `` Umkhonto we Sizwe '' shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the ANC would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts , including the armed struggle .

Without him , <head> said </head> Mr. Sisulu , the freeing of the others `` is only a half-measure . '' President F.W. de Klerk released the ANC men -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress , a rival liberation group -- as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government . But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country .

Another big question hovering over the debate is what President Bush thinks . He has been resisting a stripped-down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut . But Republican senators <head> saw </head> no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the 60 votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor , so they went ahead with the streamlined bill . The Senate bill was stripped of many popular , though revenue-losing , provisions , a number of which are included in the House-passed bill . These include a child-care initiative and extensions of soon-to-expire tax breaks for low-income housing and research-and-development expenditures .

The population of all four states is on the upswing , according to new Census Bureau estimates , following declines throughout the early 1980s . The gains , to be sure , are rather small . Iowa , for instance , <head> saw </head> its population grow by 11,000 people , or 0.4 % , between 1987 and 1988 , the Census Bureau says .

Between 1987 and 1988 , North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest to lose population , a loss of 4,000 people .

Italy 's most popular series is a drama called `` La Piovra , '' or `` The Octopus , '' which chronicles the fight of an idealistic young investigator in Palermo against the Mafia .

The toy makers , and their foreign buyers , cite uncertainty about China 's economic and political policies . `` Nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket , '' says David Yeh , chairman and chief executive officer of International Matchbox Group Ltd .

With the European Community <head> set </head> to remove its internal trade barriers in 1992 , several Hong Kong companies are beginning to consider Spain , Portugal and Greece as possible manufacturing sites .

Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry , causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management .

The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago , with $ 48 billion in assets , said it <head> set </head> aside $ 200 million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries .

First Chicago since 1987 has reduced its loans to such nations to $ 1.7 billion from $ 3 billion .

A further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other , more sweeping changes proposed -- but not implemented -- after the last crash . Most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force , which analyzed the 1987 crash , would be revived -- especially because that group 's chairman is now the Treasury secretary . The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as <head> setting </head> consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets . But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended . Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` hot-line '' communications among exchanges .

Interpretation , naturally , remains the role of the therapist , but orientation -- not only the patient 's vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic background , but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways of danger spots in his relationship to people -- can be considerably beefed up by the linguist . His esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties , making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient . In one now-historic first interview , for example , the transcript ( reproduced from the book , The First Five Minutes ) goes like this : The therapist 's level tone is bland and neutral -- he has , for example , avoided stressing `` you '' , which would imply disapproval ; ; or surprise , which would <head> set </head> the patient apart from other people . The patient , on the other hand , is far from neutral ; ; aside from her specifically regional accent , she reveals by the use of the triad , `` irritable , tense , depressed '' , a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language ( i.e. , she must have had at least a high-school education ) , and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before . Then she catapults into `` everything and everybody '' , putting particular violence on `` everybody '' , indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag -- that is , it is not congruent to the patient 's general style of speech up to this point .

These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case .

In an interview , Donald Beall , chairman , said first-half profit certainly would trail the past year 's , primarily because of weakness in the heavy-truck and passenger-car markets . Still , he added , if the industrial sector remains relatively stable , Rockwell should be able to recover in the second half and about equal fiscal 1989 's operating profit of $ 630.9 million . For fiscal 1989 's fourth quarter , Rockwell 's net income totaled $ 126.1 million , or 50 cents a <head> share </head> . That compares with operating earnings of $ 132.9 million , or 49 cents a share , the year earlier .

The cases quickly went to court , but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand they used . Beginning in 1980 , courts in several states including California and New York decided to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable . Courts made the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same , and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their <head> share </head> of the original sales . This has some logic . Drug makers should n't be able to duck liability because people could n't identify precisely which identical drug was used .

But courts quickly tumbled down a slippery slope . Just as all plaintiffs are not alike , it turns out that DES defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties . The ultimate result came in Hymowitz v. Lilly , where the highest New York court expanded the market-share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove Mindy Hymowitz 's mother did n't use their pill must still pay their <head> share </head> of any damages . But as Duke University law professor William Van Alstyne notes , by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable in New York for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in California . Despite the Supreme Court 's refusal to hear the case , there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants .

As more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy , these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and , eventually , eliminated . The current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the S&amp;P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market . The New York Stock Exchange 's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors ' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of <head> shares </head> . So if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget , how did `` program trading '' evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers ? All arguments against program trading , even those pressed without fact , conclude with three expected results after `` reforms '' are implemented : 1 ) reduced volatility , 2 ) a long-term investment focus , and 3 ) a level playing field for the small investor .

The sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments , running from an import exemption for a California airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of Panama 's quota of exports to the profitable U.S. market . Panama was stripped of this right because of U.S. differences with the Noriega regime , but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21-month period ending Sept. 30 , 1990 . About a quarter of this <head> share </head> has already been reallocated , according to the industry , but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current U.S. price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate .

Rep. Jerry Lewis , a conservative Californian , added a provision of his own intended to assist Bolivia , and the Senate then broadened the list further by including all countries in the U.S. Caribbean Basin initiate as well as the Philippines - backed by the powerful Hawaii Democrat Sen.

Then exhilaration . Spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of Friday 's 190.58-point plunge , gaining 88.12 to 2657.38 . It was the fourth-biggest advance for the average of 30 blue chips , on frenetic New York Stock Exchange volume of 416,290,000 <head> shares </head> -- the highest since the days after the 1987 crash . While the advance cheered investors who feared a 1987-style crash would occur yesterday , it was strictly a big-stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders . A troubling sign : Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered advancers , 975 to 749 , and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday 's late Big Board plunge .

Two years ago , Tokyo 's biggest fall came the day after New York 's 22.6 % Black Monday plunge , when the Nikkei average fell 14.9 % . Thus , market participants yesterday were looking ahead nervously to Wall Street 's opening . But in New York yesterday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 88.12 to close at 2657.38 on heavy volume of 416,290,000 <head> shares </head> , although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market .

'' Other fund managers were similarly sanguine . `` We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities , '' said Masato Murakami , chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking Co .

While reaching blockbuster proportions yesterday , the volume was still well within the 600 million-share capacity that the exchange has said it can handle daily since beefing up its computers after the October 1987 crash . The so-called circuit breakers devised by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to quell free falls in stock and futures prices were n't triggered yesterday because the markets were higher for most of the day .

The new offer , which seeks 50.3 % of the cellular and broadcasting concern , is for $ 125 a <head> share </head> for 22 million LIN shares . McCaw 's revised tender offer would require McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN . LIN is asking McCaw to clarify its tender offer , which challenges an agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN to merge their cellular-telephone businesses .

Inland Steel Industries Inc. expects to report that third-quarter earnings dropped more than 50 % from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs .

At the same time , the integrated-steel business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses , as well as higher labor costs under its new contract .

Assuming that the market does n't head into a bottomless free fall , some executives think Friday 's action could prove a harbinger of good news -- as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be abating . `` This is a reaction to artificial LBO valuations , rather than to any fundamentals , '' said John Young , chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co. , whose <head> shares </head> dropped $ 3.125 to $ 48.125 . `` If we get rid of a lot of that nonsense , it will be a big plus .

While Hong Kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares , Salomon 's warrants are the first here to be issued by a third party .

The Hong Kong Telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in Europe , the bankers added , because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the Hong Kong market that has international appeal .

The plant usually accounts for 20 % to 25 % of Quantum 's polyethylene production and 50 % of its ethylene production . Not everything looks grim for Quantum . The plant expansion should strengthen the company 's sway in the polyethylene business , where market <head> share </head> is often taken through sheer capacity . By lifting ethylene production , the expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs .

Takeover-stock traders today will be scrambling to learn of any UAL developments , and other takeover stocks are likely to trade in sympathy .

Still , the consensus seems almost as wide that one faltering bid is no reason to write down the value of all U.S. business .

The real value of all <head> shares </head> , after all , is directly impacted by the tax on any profits ( all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not `` ordinary income '' ) .

Canada 's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net U.S. crude imports , said John Lichtblau , president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation . That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest <head> source </head> of imported crude , behind Saudi Arabia , Nigeria and Mexico . Mr. Lichtblau said Canada 's declining crude output , combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude , will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas , particularly the Middle East . `` It 's very much a growing concern .

Most threatened by closer British Aerospace-Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals , including Matra S.A. in France and Britain 's General Electric Co. PLC .

Yesterday , a <head> source </head> close to GEC confirmed that his company may join the Ferranti fight , as part of a possible consortium that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF .

But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid , the source indicated .

With the harvest winding down , however , some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver .

4 . Good programs are not cheap .

If we want to support students , we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more scholarships based on something called `` scholarship , '' rather than on the government 's idea of `` service .

To the extent we lack manpower to staff menial jobs in hospitals , for example , we should raise pay , pursue labor-saving technology , or allow more legal immigration , rather than overpay high school graduates as short-term workers and cause resentment among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs . Will national service , in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted ?

Majority Whip William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House , and the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban .

Moreover , explains one HUD official , the NAHB remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production . The association is pushing an extensive and expensive wish-list , which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ 15 billion annually . It would like to peg the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95 % of the median price in a particular market , instead of limiting it to $ 101,250 ; reduce ( or even eliminate ) FHA down-payment requirements and increase the availability of variable-rate mortgages ; expand the Veterans Affairs Department loan guarantee program ; provide `` adequate '' funding for the Farmers Home Administration ( FmHA ) ; increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental housing , including $ 4 billion in block grants to <head> states </head> and localities ; and `` fully fund '' the McKinney Act , a $ 656 million potpourri for the homeless . Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past , and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well-connected developers and lobbyists , as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal , or congressmen . Indirect subsidies , through the FHA , for instance , are little better .

In its nicely produced publication `` Where Will Our Children Live ?

But while the NAHB has suggested actions that <head> states </head> and localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers , the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to , say , its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate counterproductive controls .

The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a Minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion . The administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by Chief Justice William Rehnquist last July when the high court upheld Missouri 's abortion restrictions .

He has ample motive to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found less than forthright on numerous points . Nevertheless , the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity .

Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the Koskotas affair that PASOK members of Parliament voted to refer them to the special court . But eluding parliamentary probe was the case of millions of drachmas Mr. Koskotas funneled into New Democracy coffers .

The State Statistical Bureau found that more than 1 billion yuan ( $ 270 million ) was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies . The newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to `` become very unreasonable '' and reduce needed funds for investment in the `` already difficult <head> state </head> budget . '' The aim of the austerity measures was to slice economic growth , which soared to 20.7 % last year , to 8 % in 1990 . Economists now predict the growth rate will be about 11.5 % for the year .

Clearly , a new rationale for national service had to be cooked up . What better place to turn than Sen. Edward Kennedy 's Labor Committee , that great stove of government expansionism , where many a stagnant pot of porridge is kept on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle cuisine ? In this case , the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle : a demonstration project for educational aid ( particularly satisfying to the DLC and Sen. Sam Nunn ) , a similar demonstration program for youth conservation ( a la Sen. Chris Dodd ) , a competitive grants program to <head> states </head> to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects ( a Kennedy specialty ) , a community service work-study program for students ( pleasing to the palate of Sen. Dale Bumpers , among others ) , plus engorgement of the VISTA volunteer program and the Retired Senior Volunteer , Foster Grandparent , and Senior Companion programs . Before the menu is printed , the House may add more ingredients , also changing the initial price , now posted at some $ 330 million . It is widely known that `` too many cooks spoil the broth , '' but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the cooks , especially if they are senators .

Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine <head> states </head> where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated . The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake , and to reflect the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition . Hoylake dropped its initial # 13.35 billion ( $ 20.71 billion ) takeover bid after it received the extension , but said it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of Farmers to Axa receives regulatory approval .

`` Obviously IBM can give bigger discounts to users immediately , '' said Mr. Weiss . But Mr. Treybig questions whether that will be enough to stop Tandem 's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from Big Blue 's machines . `` The answer is n't price reductions , but new <head> systems </head> , '' he said . Nevertheless , Tandem faces a variety of challenges , the biggest being that customers generally view the company 's computers as complementary to IBM 's mainframes . Even Mr. Treybig is reluctant to abandon this notion , insisting that Tandem 's new machines are n't replacements for IBM 's mainframes .

Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. said it will delay a proposed two-step , 830 million Canadian-dollar ( US$ 705.6 million ) expansion of its <head> system </head> because Canada 's output of crude oil is shrinking . Interprovincial , Canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S. , said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991 , 8 % lower than a previous estimate . Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level .

Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level . `` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said Ronald Watkins , vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial 's parent , Interhome Energy Inc . Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial 's <head> system </head> is down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s . `` There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , '' he said . Many of Canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly .

Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada . Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude . Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial 's <head> system </head> , whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region , including Chicago , Buffalo , Toronto and Montreal . Canada 's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net U.S. crude imports , said John Lichtblau , president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation . That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude , behind Saudi Arabia , Nigeria and Mexico .

But when something is inevitable , you learn to live with it , '' he said . Mr. Lichtblau stressed that the delay of Interprovincial 's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude , however , since Canadian imports are limited in any case by Canada 's falling output . Under terms of its proposed two-step expansion , which would have required regulatory approval , Interprovincial intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its <head> system </head> , beginning with a modest expansion by 1991 .

The debate over National Service has begun again . After a decade in which more than 50 localities established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school <head> systems </head> made community service a prerequisite to high-school graduation , the focus has shifted to Washington . At least 10 bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in Congress this spring . One , co-sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn ( D. , Ga . ) and Rep. Dave McCurdy ( D. , Okla. ) , would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served .

Mind you , most of `` the volunteers '' would be unskilled 17 - to 18-year-olds , some not even high school graduates , and many saving money by living at home .

As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant <head> system </head> , so the national-service devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of `` give in order to get .

You may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment -- I certainly do -- but you know any comparison of over-all American strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United States not only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of U.S.-Soviet relations for the foreseeable future .

Communist political warfare , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages . Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win , the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant -- in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators , at the United Nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences -- preferably at the highest level . The Soviets understand , moreover , that the first step in <head> turning </head> a country toward Communism is to turn it against the West . Thus , typically , the first stage of a Communist takeover is to `` neutralize '' a country . The second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist '' , while in fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy .

Communist political warfare , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages . Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win , the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant -- in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators , at the United Nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences -- preferably at the highest level . The Soviets understand , moreover , that the first step in turning a country toward Communism is to <head> turn </head> it against the West . Thus , typically , the first stage of a Communist takeover is to `` neutralize '' a country . The second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist '' , while in fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy .

Within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in Alaska , Arizona and California , the quake 's epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees East longitude . While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the Pacific ( Midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water ) , the Hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at Honolulu at 23:30 Greenwich time . It <head> turned </head> out that the waves were not so high as in 1946 .

But not a single human life was lost , and property damage in the Hawaiian Islands did not exceed $ 800,000 .

Hercules L. Dousman , fur trader and merchant at Prairie Du Chien , contracted to supply Selkirk 's people with some 300 head of cattle , and Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe were hired as drovers . Bailly , after leaving Fort Snelling in August 1821 , was forced to leave some of the cattle at the Hudson 's Bay Company 's post on Lake Traverse `` in the Sieux Country '' and reached Fort Garry , as the Selkirk Hudson 's Bay Company center was now called , late in the fall .

Twice he had failed , and the Muscovy Company indicated it would not back him again .

This time he <head> turned </head> westward , to the middle Atlantic coast of North America . His chief discovery was important -- the Great North ( later , the Hudson ) River -- but it produced no northwest passage . When the Half Moon put in at Dartmouth , England , in the fall of 1609 , word of Hudson 's findings leaked out , and English interest in him revived .

Heydrich , in opening the Conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as `` a complement to '' previous `` solutions '' for eliminating the Jews from German living space through violence , economic strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation . In other words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder .

In point of fact , volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today . Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile , usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change ( 1973-75 , 1937-40 , and 1928-33 for example ) . It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream `` foul '' on program trading when the markets decline , while hailing the great <head> values </head> still abounding as the markets rise . Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks , instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins ? Some of the proposed fixes for what is labeled `` program-trading volatility '' could be far worse than the perceived problem .

As a U.S.-based company , Blue Arrow would have to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years , creating a continuing drag on reported earnings . Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm , operating unit or assets over the current or fair market <head> value </head> of those assets . But with so many shares now held in the U.S. , Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways , based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards . `` Our balance sheets look like they came from Alice 's wonderland , '' Mr. Fromstein said .

The official China Daily said retail prices of non-staple foods have n't risen since last December but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down .

The newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real <head> values </head> of commodities to `` become very unreasonable '' and reduce needed funds for investment in the `` already difficult state budget . '' The aim of the austerity measures was to slice economic growth , which soared to 20.7 % last year , to 8 % in 1990 . Economists now predict the growth rate will be about 11.5 % for the year .

Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique , which is widely thought to have worsened the 1987 crash . Not really insurance , this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S&amp;P futures contracts . In its severest test , the $ 60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash did n't <head> work </head> , as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected .

Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of life . The farmer must get up early , and , at times , work late at night . Frequently he must <head> work </head> long hours in the hot sun or cold rain . No matter how well work is planned , bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up . It may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably .

Part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost , provided the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs . For some retired persons , part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income . It is particularly suitable for those who need to <head> work </head> or exercise out of doors for their health . Generally , the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city . The savings are not as great , however , as is sometime supposed .

As a rule , part-time farmers hire little help . In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 . List the number of hours the family can be expected to <head> work </head> each month . You may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one . Do not include all your spare time or all your family 's spare time -- only what you are willing to use for farm work .

Perhaps they are mourning a recent death and want comfort , to feel in touch with the deceased , or seek indications for future plans . They may , of course , be curiosity seekers -- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship . The mediums with whom the Parapsychology Foundation is <head> working </head> in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated state , so that the sitter can make comments , ask and answer questions , instead of talking with a `` control '' who speaks through an entranced sensitive . What we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary conversation . But it is not really only a conversation .

Superior new material for orthodontic work is another result of research . Plastics are easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly used , and they save time and money . Plaster of Paris , once utilized in making impressions of teeth , has been replaced by alginates ( gelatin-like material ) that <head> work </head> quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child . Prevention is best as a rule , the earlier general dental treatment is started , the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be . `` After your child 's baby teeth are all in -- usually at the age of two and one half to three -- it 's time for that first dental appointment '' , Dr. Brodie advises .

At least she never knew what the bottom was like '' . I am a carpet salesman . I <head> work </head> for one of the biggest chains of retail carpet houses in the East . We cater mostly to nice people in the $ 5-8,000 annual income bracket and we run a string of snazzy , neon-lit , chromium-plated suburban stores . I am selling the stuff of which is made one of the Great American Dreams -- wall-to-wall carpeting .

In some cases , however , domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary , triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need . Thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed -- the one place he can still be champion . If his on-the-job problems <head> work </head> out , he may return to his old pattern . Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she feels age creeping up . On the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable .

This is obvious when it is remembered that , during childbirth , the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby . The intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control . But an instinctive reflex may <head> work </head> against the conscious intention of the woman . That is , when first penetration takes place , the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain . The advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological .

Folk-lore , superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific facts and useful hints . The importance of loving tenderness is obvious . The long , unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play <head> work </head> on several levels . Under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases , providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration . Extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall ( the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back ) may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin .
