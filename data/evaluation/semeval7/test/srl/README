There are a few changes to the conll-2005 format.  There is a id
column and arguments of only one predicate are mentined per space
separated list of examples.


The columns represent the following:

column  1: Example ID
column  2: Word
column  3: Verbnet class
column  4: PropBank Frame sense
column  5: Part of Speech
column  6: Parse fragment (as represented in the standard conll format)
column  7: The predicate
column  8: PropBank argument
column  9: Thematic Role


The last two columns in the test file should be replaced with the
hypothesized argument.

in order to score the test, all you need to do is print out the 
two columns -- The predicate and the argument column and use the
CoNLL-2005 scorer srl-eval.pl available at http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~srlconll/soft.html
